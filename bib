               explored the extent of reported R use in the field of ecology
               using the Web of Science and text mining. We analyzed the
               frequencies of R packages reported in more than 60,000
               peer‐reviewed articles published in 30 ecology journals during a
               10‐yr period ending in 2017. The number of studies reported
               using R as their primary tool in data analysis increased
               linearly from 11.4\% in 2008 to 58.0\% in 2017. The top 10
               packages reported were lme4, vegan, nlme, ape, MuMIn, MASS,
               mgcv, ade4, multcomp, and car. The increasing popularity of R
               has most likely furthered open science in ecological research

               workflows when scripts and codes are included and shared. These
               findings may not be entirely unique to R because there are other
               programming languages used by ecologists, but they do strongly
               suggest that given the relatively high frequency of reported use
               of R, it is a significant component of contemporary analytics in

              environmental factors implicated in the population decline of
              Song Thrushes Turdus philomelos in rural Britain since the
              mid-1970s, and present new analyses of regional variation in
              population changes. Increased mortality during the first year of
              life (from fledging to recruitment) is highlighted as a potential
              demographic mechanism having driven the population decline, while
              Song Thrushes in a rapidly declining farmland population were
              making too few nesting attempts to sustain local numbers.
              Breeding Song Thrushes are strongly associated with non-cropped
              habitats such as woodland edge, field boundaries, gardens and
              scrub; they make substantial use of grassland, but avoid cereals
              when foraging. Earthworms constitute a key component of Song
              Thrush diet and the availability of this prey is strongly
              influenced by moisture levels in surface soils. Several lines of
              evidence suggest that dry surface soils during summer are
              deleterious to the productivity and survival of Song Thrushes,
              and regional variation in the rates of population change in
              Britain during 1970--86 was negatively correlated with the extent
              of under-field drainage on farmland (the main function of which
              is to promote the drying of surface soils). Increasing dryness of
              agricultural soils and the loss of grassland from eastern arable
              counties have probably both contributed to the declines of rural
              Song Thrushes in Britain. Loss of hedgerows and scrub, and the
              degradation of woodland may also have contributed to population
              declines but the role of predators remains unclear. Recovery of
              rural Song Thrush populations requires challenging new policy
              initiatives that should aim to restore nesting cover (scrub and
              woodland understorey), grazed grassland in arable-dominated areas
              and damper soils in summer.",

  abstract = "Background--Several studies have shown an inverse relationship
              between ideal cardiovascular health (CVH) and mortality. However,
              there are no studies that pool these data to show the shape of
              the relationship and quantify the mortality benefit from ideal
              CVH. Methods and Results--We conducted a systematic internet
              literature search of multiple databases including MEDLINE, Web of
              Science, Embase, CINAHL, and Scopus for longitudinal studies
              assessing the relationship between ideal CVH and mortality in
              adults, published between January 1, 2010, and May 31, 2017. We
              included studies that assessed the relationship between ideal CVH
              and mortality in populations that were initially free of
              cardiovascular disease. We conducted a dose-response
              meta-analysis generating both study-specific and pooled trends
              from the correlated log hazard ratio estimates of mortality
              across categories of ideal CVH metrics. A total of 6 studies were
              included in the meta-analysis. All of the studies indicated a
              linear decrease in (cardiovascular disease and all-cause)
              mortality with increasing ideal CVH metrics. Overall, each unit
              increase in CVH metrics was associated with a pooled hazard ratio
              for cardiovascular disease mortality of 0.81 (95\% confidence
              interval, 0.75-0.87), while each unit increase in ideal CVH
              metrics was associated with a pooled hazard ratio of 0.89 (95\%
              confidence interval, 0.86-0.93) for allcause mortality.
              Conclusions--Our meta-analysis showed a strong inverse linear
              dose-response relationship between ideal CVH metrics and both
              all-cause and cardiovascular disease-related mortality. This
              study suggests that even modest improvements in CVH is associated
              with substantial mortality benefit, thus providing a strong
              public health message advocating for even the smallest

              of families and the social context of environments, economics,
              policies, and so on. This system includes five main linked views:
              the Scatter-plot View to provide an overview of the data and
              further explore the correlation analysis, the Tree View to show

              behavior therapy I highlight our success and the need for
              thoughtfulness in subsequent behavior therapy research. Next I
              comment on where I think we need to go, including the need to
              attend to effective implementation, the importance of training
              clinicians in clinical assessment, and training our graduate
              students without fragilizing them. I then highlight the need for
              certification of behavior therapists to protect the public, the
              need to eliminate ``talk therapy'' as a definition of behavior
              therapy, and finally I comment on the importance of harnessing

  abstract = "Purpose:. Both regulatory science and clinical practice rely on
              best available scientific data to guide decision-making. However,
              changes in clinical practice may be driven by numerous other
              factors such as cost. In this review, we reexamine noteworthy
              examples where pharmacogenetic testing information was added to
              drug labeling to explore how the available evidence, potential
              public health impact, and predictive utility of each
              pharmacogenetic biomarker impacts clinical uptake. Summary:.
              Advances in the field of pharmacogenetics have led to new
              discoveries about the genetic basis for variability in drug
              response. The Food and Drug Administration recognizes the value
              of pharmacogenetic testing strategies and has been proactive
              about incorporating pharmaco-genetic information into the
              labeling of both new drugs and drugs already on the market.
              Although some examples have readily translated to routine
              clinical practice, clinical uptake of genetic testing for many
              drugs has been limited. Conclusion:. Both regulatory science and
              clinical practice rely on data-driven approaches to guide
              decision making; however, additional factors are also important
              in clinical practice that do not impact regulatory decision
              making, and these considerations may result in heterogeneity in

              When multiple perspectives are present in a decision problem,
              critical issues arise and often require the balancing of goals.
              In our approach, meeting patients' clinical needs in a timely

              the level of appropriate resources. The simulation-optimization

              impact of Public Reporting (PR) on clinical outcomes, we carried
              out a systematic review of published studies on this topic.
              Methods: Pubmed, Web of Science and SCOPUS databases were
              searched to identify studies published from 1991 to 2014 that
              investigated the relationship between PR and clinical outcomes.
              Studies were considered eligible if they investigated the
              relationship between PR and clinical outcomes and comprehensively
              described the PR mechanism and the study design adopted. Among
              the clinical outcomes identified, meta-analysis was performed for

              also the quality of the studies using a GRADE approach. Results:
              Twenty-seven studies were included. Mainly, the effect of PR on

  abstract = "Air pollution is an emerging public health concern as there are
              increasing evidences that the quality of air adversely affects
              human health due to the presence of various toxic pollutants.
              Linking air pollution from its source to adverse human health
              effects is a complicated phenomenon that requires a
              multidisciplinary approach for better understanding.
              Decision-makers need relevant, comprehensive estimates of the
              disease burden attributable to different risk factors. Many
              statistical models have become very relevant for estimating
              atmospheric concentrations by analysis of complex datasets to
              produce inferences and predictions that can lead to better
              management of air pollution. This paper focuses on the Indian
              scenario as a case study and presents the current status of air
              quality in India with special reference to particulate matter.
              The study suggest that air-quality networks need to be developed
              that can depict and forecast pollution levels with health
              advisories for public and for pollution emergencies measures.
              Development of statistical models, and methods for Big Data
              Analytics, can yield a wide array of actionable insights to
              facilitate policy decisions. Models may also be used to predict
              the cost of the air-pollution control measures as well as the
              benefits in terms of the control of acute and chronic diseases
              caused by air pollution. This study concludes that the
              application of statistical models and algorithms can act as an
              important tool to bridge the gap between science and policy.

              which includes cases of emotional, physical and sexual abuse. The
              purpose of the present study was to provide a systematic review
              and meta-analysis study by reviewing the studies on the various
              forms of physical, sexual, and emotional violence. Materials and
              Methods: This study included, the full-text studies on domestic
              violence against women performed from 2001 to 2014. Finally a
              total of 52 articles were selected using national and
              international data bases such as Science Direct, Scopus, Magiran
              PreQuest, SID, Google Schola, and Pubmed. Data analysis was done
              by meta-analysis method, applying random effects model. Study
              heterogeneity was measured by I2 test. The data were analyzed by
              STATA version 11. 2. Results: The prevalence rate of
              emotional-mental violence (59\% with CI 95\%: 50-67) was higher
              than those of physical violence (45 \% with CI 95\%: 34-55) and
              sexual violence (32\% with CI 95\%: 25-50). Meta-regression
              results indicated a chronologically decreasing trend in the
              prevalence rates of sexual (P=0. 083) and physical (P=0. 276)
              violence; and a chronologically increasing trend in the
              prevalence rate of domestic violence (P=0. 377). Conclusion:
              Considering the high prevalence rate of domestic violence among
              the Iranian women (especially emotional violence), more studies
              are necessary to determine predisposing factors for emotional
              violence. We can also prevent the increasing trend of emotional
              violence by following policies advocating a higher level of
              social support for women and increasing the awareness of the
              public about the importance of the issue. \copyright{} 2017,

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Depression represents a growing public health burden.
              Understanding how screen time (ST) in juveniles may be associated
              with risk of depression is critical for the development of
              prevention and intervention strategies. Findings from studies
              addressing this question thus far have been inconsistent.
              Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review and
              meta-analysis of data related to this question. METHODS: The
              meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA
              guideline. We searched the electronic databases of PubMed, Web of
              Science and EBSCO systematically (up to 6 May 2015). OR was
              adopted as the pooled measurement of association between ST and
              depression risk. Dose-response was estimated by a generalised
              least squares trend estimation. RESULTS: Twelve cross-sectional
              studies and four longitudinal studies (including 1 cohort study)
              involving a total of 127 714 participants were included. Overall,
              higher ST in preadolescent children and adolescents was
              significantly associated with a higher risk of depression
              (OR=1.12; 95\% CI 1.03 to 1.22). Screen type, age, population and
              reference category acted as significant moderators. Compared with
              the reference group who had no ST, there was a non-linear
              dose-response association of ST with a decreasing risk of
              depression at ST<2 h/day, with the lowest risk being observed for
              1 h/day (OR=0.88; 95\% CI 0.84 to 0.93). CONCLUSIONS: Our
              meta-analysis suggests that ST in children and adolescents is
              associated with depression risk in a non-linear dose-response
              manner. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited. For

  abstract = "Background: Benzathine penicillin G (BPG) is the only recommended
              treatment to prevent mother-to-child transmission of syphilis.
              Due to recent reports of country-level shortages of BPG, an
              evaluation was undertaken to quantify countries that have
              experienced shortages in the past 2 years and to describe factors
              contributing to these shortages. Methods and findings:
              Country-level data about BPG shortages were collected using 3
              survey approaches. First, a survey designed by the WHO Department
              of Reproductive Health and Research was distributed to 41
              countries and territories in the Americas and 41 more in Africa.
              Second, WHO conducted an email survey of 28 US Centers for
              Disease Control and Prevention country directors. An additional
              13 countries were in contact with WHO for related congenital
              syphilis prevention activities and also reported on BPG
              shortages. Third, the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI)
              collected data from 14 countries (where it has active operations)
              to understand the extent of stock-outs, in-country purchasing,
              usage behavior, and breadth of available purchasing options to
              identify stock-outs worldwide. CHAI also conducted in-person
              interviews in the same 14 countries to understand the extent of
              stock-outs, in-country purchasing and usage behavior, and
              available purchasing options. CHAI also completed a desk review
              of 10 additional high-income countries, which were also included.
              BPG shortages were attributable to shortfalls in supply, demand,
              and procurement in the countries assessed. This assessment should
              not be considered globally representative as countries not
              surveyed may also have experienced BPG shortages. Country
              contacts may not have been aware of BPG shortages when surveyed
              or may have underreported medication substitutions due to
              desirability bias. Funding for the purchase of BPG by countries
              was not evaluated. In all, 114 countries and territories were
              approached to provide information on BPG shortages occurring
              during 2014--2016. Of unique countries and territories, 95 (83\%)
              responded or had information evaluable from public records. Of
              these 95 countries and territories, 39 (41\%) reported a BPG
              shortage, and 56 (59\%) reported no BPG shortage; 10 (12\%)
              countries with and without BPG shortages reported use of
              antibiotic alternatives to BPG for treatment of maternal
              syphilis. Market exits, inflexible production cycles, and minimum
              order quantities affect BPG supply. On the demand side,
              inaccurate forecasts and sole sourcing lead to under-procurement.
              Clinicians may also incorrectly prescribe BPG substitutes due to
              misperceptions of quality or of the likelihood of adverse
              outcomes. Conclusions: Targets for improvement include drug
              forecasting and procurement, and addressing provider reluctance
              to use BPG. Opportunities to improve global supply, demand, and
              use of BPG should be prioritized alongside congenital syphilis
              elimination efforts. \copyright{} 2017 Public Library of Science.

              addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic, including the President's
              Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), have successfully
              contributed to reducing HIV/AIDS related morbidity and mortality.
              However, there is still debate about whether these
              disease-specific programs have improved or harmed health systems
              overall, especially with respect to non-HIV health needs.
              Methods: As part of a larger evaluation of PEPFAR's effects on
              the health system between 2005-2011, we collected qualitative and
              quantitative data through semi-structured interviews with
              District Health Officers (DHOs) from all 112 districts in Uganda.
              We asked DHOs to share their perceptions about the ways in which
              HIV programs (largely PEPFAR in the Ugandan context) had helped
              and harmed the health system. We then identified key themes among
              their responses using qualitative content analysis. Results:
              Ugandan DHOs said PEPFAR had generally helped the health system
              by improving training, integrating HIV and non-HIV care, and
              directly providing resources. To a lesser extent, DHOs said
              PEPFAR caused the health system to focus too narrowly on
              HIV/AIDS, increased workload for already overburdened staff, and
              encouraged doctors to leave public sector jobs for higher-paid
              positions with HIV/AIDS programs. Conclusion: Health system
              leaders in Uganda at the district level were appreciative of
              resources aimed at HIV they could often apply for broader
              purposes. As HIV infection becomes a chronic disease requiring
              strong health systems to manage sustained patient care over time,
              Uganda's weak health systems will require broad infrastructure
              improvements inconsistent with narrow vertical health

  title    = "Effects of ambient air pollution exposure on olfaction: A review",
  author   = "Ajmani, G S and Suh, H H and Pinto, J M",
  abstract = "Background: Olfactory dysfunction affects millions of people
              worldwide. This sensory impairment is associated with
              neurodegenerative disease and significantly decreased quality of
              life. Exposure to airborne pollutants has been implicated in
              olfactory decline, likely due to the anatomic susceptibility of
              the olfactory nerve to the environment. Historically, studies
              have focused on occupational exposures, but more recent studies
              have considered effects from exposure to ambient air pollutants.
              Objectives: To examine all relevant human data evaluating a link
              between ambient pollution exposure and olfaction and to review
              supporting animal data in order to examine potential mechanisms
              for pollution-associated olfactory loss. Methods: We identified
              and reviewed relevant articles from 1950 to 2015 using PubMed and
              Web of Science and focusing on human epidemiologic and
              pathophysiologic studies. Animal studies were included only to
              support pertinent data on humans. We reviewed findings from these
              studies evaluating a relationship between environmental pollutant
              exposure and olfactory function. Results: We identified and
              reviewed 17 articles, with 1 additional article added from a
              bibliography search, for a total of 18 human studies. There is
              evidence in human epidemiologic and pathologic studies that
              increased exposure to ambient air pollutants is associated with
              olfactory dysfunction. However, most studies have used proxies
              for pollution exposure in small samples of convenience. Human
              pathologic studies, with supporting animal work, have also shown
              that air pollution can contact the olfactory epithelium,
              translocate to the olfactory bulb, and migrate to the olfactory
              cortex. Pollutants can deposit at each location, causing direct
              damage and disruption of tissue morphology or inducing local
              inflammation and cellular stress responses. Conclusions: Ambient
              air pollution may impact human olfactory function. Additional
              studies are needed to examine air pollution-related olfactory
              impacts on the general population using measured pollution
              exposures and to link pollution exposure with olfactory
              dysfunction and related pathology. \copyright{} 2016, Public

              adults in rural and urban communities of Ilorin West Local
              Government Area, North-Central Nigeria. Materials and Methods:
              This was a cross-sectional comparative study. Respondents were
              selected through Multi-stage sampling technique. Interviewer
              administered structured questionnaire, clinical report form were
              used to collect data. Data were analyzed using Statistical
              Package for Social Sciences. version 15. Level of statistical
              significance was set at P value less than 0.05. Results: More of
              the rural than urban respondents had ever used traditional eye
              pencil and this was found to be associated with glaucoma within
              rural (P=0.029) and urban areas (P=0.009).The prevalence of

              urban area, 37 (8.2\%) with a P value of 0.037. Age, educational
              status.and religions were the significant predictors of uptake of
              traditional eye pencil common in both rural and urban areas.
              Conclusion: The high uptake of traditional eye pencil obtained
              from this study and association with glaucoma calls for urgent
              awareness/sensitization campaign in the communities.Regular
              community-based eye screening will be useful in early detection

              years to assess nutrient intake, dietary quality, menu
              performance, food acceptability, cost, and effectiveness of
              nutrition education in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP).
              Objective Describe methods used to measure food waste and
              respective results in the NSLP across time. Methods A systematic
              review using PubMed, Science Direct, Informaworld, and Institute
              of Scientific Information Web of Knowledge was conducted using
              the following search terms: waste, school lunch, plate waste,
              food waste, kitchen, half method, quarter method, weight, and
              photography. Studies published through June 2015 were included.
              The systematic review followed preferred reporting items for
              systematic reviews and meta-analyses recommendations. Results The
              final review included 53 articles. Food waste methodologies
              included in-person visual estimation (n=11), digital photography
              (n=11), direct weighing (n=23), and a combination of in-person
              visual estimation, digital photography, and/or direct weighing
              (n=8). A majority of studies used a pre--post intervention or
              cross-sectional design. Fruits and vegetables were the most
              researched dietary component on the lunch tray and yielded the
              greatest amount of waste across studies. Conclusions Food waste
              is commonly assessed in the NSLP, but the methods are diverse and
              reporting metrics are variable. Future research should focus on
              establishing more uniform metrics to measure and report on food
              waste in the NSLP. Consistent food waste measurement methods will
              allow for better comparisons between studies. Such measures may
              facilitate better decision making about NSLP practices, programs,
              and policies that influence student consumption patterns across
              settings and interventions. \copyright{} 2017 Academy of

              relation to the growth of nurse prescribing competence from the
              perspective of the nurses studying in a prescribing programme.
              Background: The number of nurses enrolled in a nurse prescribing
              programme is rapidly increasing in Finland. However, few studies
              on nurse prescribing education are available and therefore
              research is needed, particularly from the point of view of nurses
              studying in the programme. Design: The descriptive, qualitative
              study used the text of student online learning diaries as data
              during a 14-month prescribing programme. The sample consisted of
              31 nurses, public health nurses or midwives enrolled in a
              prescribing programme at a university of applied sciences. The
              data were analysed using the inductive analysis method. Results:
              The growth of nurses' prescribing competence was facilitated by
              learning clinical examination of the patient, networking with
              peers, receiving support from the workplace and supervisors,
              doctors' positive attitude towards nurse prescribing and being
              able to apply competencies directly to nursing practice. The
              barriers to the growth of nurses' prescribing competence were
              unclear job description, incomplete care plans and concerns about
              how consultation with doctors will be organised and realised.
              Conclusions: The results show that, for the purpose of developing
              the new role and position of nurse prescribers, educators and
              nursing managers must invest more in staff awareness of nurse
              prescribing education and also offer more support to nurse
              prescribers in their workplaces. Relevance to clinical practice:
              The results of this study can be used especially in countries
              where nurse prescribing education is only in the process of being
              planned or has just been started. Heads of nursing and educators
              in prescribing education will benefit from the results when
              creating expanded job descriptions for nurses and supporting
              networking between students during the period of training.

              78\% and 80\%), reported boiling or treating drinking water (19\%
              versus 44\% and 69\%), and washing hands with soap (66\% versus
              77\% and 85\%); a significant difference was also observed in the
              proportion of households with soap available at handwashing areas
              (84\% versus 90\% and 95\%), consistent with reported behaviors.
              No significant difference was noted in the proportion of
              households testing positive for Escherichia coli in stored
              household drinking water at second follow-up (39\% versus 49\%
              and 34\%). Overall, we observed some positive, and no negative
              changes in cholera- and WaSH-related KAPs after an OCV campaign
              in Maela refugee camp. OCV campaigns may provide opportunities to

  abstract = "Purpose: Bimodal age distributions at diagnosis have been widely
              observed among US and European female breast cancer populations.
              To determine whether bimodal breast cancer distributions are also
              present in a sub-Saharan African population, we investigated
              female breast cancer in South Africa. Methods: Using the South
              African National Cancer Registry data, we examined
              age-at-diagnosis frequency distributions (density plots) for
              breast cancer overall and by their receptor (oestrogen,
              progesterone and HER2) determinants among black and white women
              diagnosed during 2009--2011 in the public healthcare sector. For
              comparison, we also analysed corresponding 2010--2011 US SEER
              data. We investigated density plots using flexible mixture
              models, allowing early/late-onset membership to depend on
              receptor status. Results: We included 8857 women from South
              Africa, 7176 (81 \%) with known oestrogen receptor status, and
              95064 US women. Bimodality was present in all races, with an
              early-onset mode between ages 40--50 years and a late-onset mode
              among ages 60--70 years. The early-onset mode was younger in
              South African black women (age 38), compared to other groups
              (45--54 years). Conclusions: Consistent patterns of bimodality
              and of its receptor determinants were present across breast
              cancer patient populations in South Africa and the US. Although
              the clinical spectrum of breast cancer is well acknowledged as
              heterogeneous, universal early- and late-onset age distributions
              at diagnosis suggest that breast cancer etiology consists of a
              mixture two main types. \copyright{} 2016, Springer

              life in Andalusia, Spain, and examines how it has changed from
              2007 to 2011. To this end, we study quality of life at the local
              level using municipal data, develop a composite index of quality
              of life inspired by the capabilities approach and recent trends
              in well-being, and apply a space--time approach using spatial
              econometric techniques. Demographic indicators, income,
              high-speed networks, education and health have the greatest
              influence in determining quality of life in Andalusia. From 2007
              to 2011, the overall quality of life in Andalusia worsened as a
              consequence of the crisis, but territorial disparities decreased.
              The quality of life in a municipality does not change randomly,
              but is determined by the municipality's quality of life in the
              previous period and changes in the quality of life in
              neighbouring municipalities in both the same time period and in
              the past. Public policies should therefore take into account that
              both history and space matter in terms of quality of life.

              wildlife, livestock and humans alike. They can threaten
              geographically isolated or critically endangered wildlife
              populations; however, relatively few studies have clearly
              demonstrated the extent to which emerging diseases can impact
              populations of common wildlife species. Here, we report the
              impact of an emerging protozoal disease on British populations of
              greenfinch Carduelis chloris and chaffinch Fringilla coelebs, two
              of the most common birds in Britain. Morphological and molecular
              analyses showed this to be due to Trichomonas gallinae.
              Trichomonosis emerged as a novel fatal disease of finches in
              Britain in 2005 and rapidly became epidemic within greenfinch,
              and to a lesser extent chaffinch, populations in 2006. By 2007,
              breeding populations of greenfinches and chaffinches in the
              geographic region of highest disease incidence had decreased by
              35\% and 21\% respectively, representing mortality in excess of
              half a million birds. In contrast, declines were less pronounced
              or absent in these species in regions where the disease was found
              in intermediate or low incidence. Also, populations of dunnock
              Prunella modularis, which similarly feeds in gardens, but in
              which T. gallinae was rarely recorded, did not decline. This is
              the first trichomonosis epidemic reported in the scientific
              literature to negatively impact populations of free-ranging
              non-columbiform species, and such levels of mortality and decline
              due to an emerging infectious disease are unprecedented in
              British wild bird populations. This disease emergence event
              demonstrates the potential for a protozoan parasite to jump avian
              host taxonomic groups with dramatic effect over a short time

              wellbeing and is associated with a wide range of environmental
              benefits. In the United Kingdom, a substantial proportion of
              urban agriculture occurs in allotment gardens, and these are a
              historically significant part of the landscape. However,
              allotment land provision has declined significantly since its
              mid-twentieth century peak. Here, we examine the magnitude and
              nature of this decline using a GIS analysis of historic Ordnance
              Survey maps covering ten British urban areas from the beginning
              of the twentieth century to the present. We find there has been a
              65\% decline in allotment land from its peak to 2016, a pattern
              also reflected in per capita provision, which declined by 62\%,
              demonstrating a long-term trend across the case study areas, and
              the loss of food provisioning land for an average of 6\% of the
              urban population. We also show that the most at-risk areas for
              food insecurity have faced eight times the level of allotment
              closures than the least deprived areas. Assessing subsequent
              land-use of former allotments, we show that 47\% of allotment
              land is now part of the urban built infrastructure, and 25\% is
              other forms of urban greenspace. Restoration of these greenspace
              sites to allotments has the potential to meet up to 100\% of the
              current levels of demand for new allotments by residents of our
              case study areas. Our results demonstrate that whilst a
              significant amount of urban agricultural land has been lost,
              opportunities for restoration exist on a substantial scale.",

              among Malaysian populations recently. Thus, there is a need for
              further early management and secondary prevention of stroke.
              Objectives: To provide an overview on knowledge, attitude and
              practice (KAP) had been carried out among stroke patients and
              general population. Data sources: Published survey studies on KAP
              had been carried out among stroke patients general population in
              Malaysia and globally. Review methods: Searches were conducted in
              two data-bases (ProQuest, EBSCOhost). Reviews were included, if
              these were based on a survey study that measures KAP between 2005
              and 2015. The authors had focused the survey study design,
              population and sampling method highlighting the tools and
              interview strategy used in order to obtain the information on
              KAP. The scope of interest were perceptions towards stroke,
              knowledge on risk factors, signs and symptoms of stroke and its
              association with socio-demography background of the participants.
              Results: A total of 22 articles were reviewed and included, but
              none of them was derived from Malaysia studies. However, only 14
              were reviewed systematically on the basis of its completeness for
              quantitative synthesis. In this article, we had reviewed the
              existing literatures on the scope mentioned earlier and compared
              it with those of developed countries. Findings highlighted the
              level of stroke knowledge on risk factors as well as signs and
              symptoms rangeing from moderate to poor. This knowledge level was
              found to be associated with age, gender, education level and
              income status. Conclusion: Study on KAP is crucial in order to
              increase the awareness about stroke disease on the risk factors
              management, administration of appropriate treatment as well as
              further secondary prevention. This findings may be adopted in

              abuse, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's. These results are based on
              the mathematical formalization of psychiatric qualitative
              knowledge related to the characterization of the conditions

              adjustment and functioning in men, who as adolescents had sexual
              experiences with men. The data came from the National Health and
              Social Life Survey, which used a national probability sample
              (Laumann, Gagnon, Michael, \& Michaels, 1994). Three perspectives
              were considered, which offered different predictions. From the
              ``child sexual abuse'' (CSA) paradigm, which dominates clinical,
              legal, and lay views, expected was robust evidence for poorer
              adjustment, given that intense harm is assumed to be intrinsic.
              From the ``mainstream psychological'' perspective, derived from
              the CSA paradigm but more scientifically based, poorer adjustment
              was also expected, but with less magnitude, given that
              minor--adult sex is seen as posing a serious risk of harm, which
              may not universally apply. From the ``relevant-empirical''
              perspective, which infers response to male adolescent--adult
              same-sex sex from relevant prior empirical research (as opposed
              to clinical cases or the female experience), expected was little

               have substantial consequences for a broad range of marine
               species and their interactions. Understanding how these
               interactions shift in response to climate change is particularly
               important with regard to foundation species, such as the brown
               alga Fucus vesiculosus. This macroalga represents the dominant
               habitat former on coastal rocky substrata of the Baltic Sea,
               fulfilling functions essential for the entire benthic community.
               Its ability to withstand extensive fouling and herbivory
               regulates the associated community and ecosystem dynamics. This
               study tested the interactive effects of future warming,
               acidification, and seasonality on the interactions of a marine
               macroalga with potential foulers and consumers. F. vesiculosus
               rockweeds were exposed to different combinations of conditions
               predicted regionally for the year 2100 (+triangle 5 degrees C,
               +triangle 700 mu atm CO2) using multifactorial longterm
               experiments in novel outdoor benthic mesocosms(''Benthocosms'')
               over 9-12-week periods in four seasons. Possible shifts in the
               macroalgal susceptibility to fouling and consumption were tested
               using consecutive bioassays. Algal susceptibility to fouling and
               grazing varied substantially among seasons and between
               treatments. In all seasons, warming predominantly affected
               anti-fouling and anti-herbivory interactions while acidification
               had a subtle nonsignificant influence. Interestingly,
               antimicrofouling activity was highest during winter under
               warming, while anti-macrofouling and anti-herbivory activities
               were highest in the summer under warming. These contrasting
               findings indicate that seasonal changes in anti-fouling and
               anti-herbivory traits may interact with ocean warming in
               altering F. vesiculosus community composition in the future. Key

              EF. Methods A scoping review of qualitative and quantitative
              studies with EF as main focus was conducted. CINAHL, PubMed,
              PubMed Central, SCOPUS, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Google
              Scholar were searched between October and November 2015 for
              data-based studies on EF published in 2010--2015. Two team
              members abstracted each paper independently using a data
              abstraction tool. Results were summarized using the Reach,
              Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM)
              framework. Results Seventeen publications met inclusion criteria.
              EF has reached and is effective across a broad population base,
              including individuals with low SES and diverse ethnic/racial
              backgrounds. EF participation may be associated with reduced risk
              for falls requiring medical care, and is associated with fewer
              hospital admissions. Analyses of medical cost savings from EF
              participation and program implementation costs suggest economic
              benefits of EF implementation for communities. Organization-level
              maintenance is facilitated by program-specific and organizational
              factors, such as instructor training and funding.
              Individual-level maintenance is facilitated by program structure,
              absence of pain, and increased quality of life. Conclusions
              More-rigorous evidence is needed about the association between
              participation in EF and conditions such as falls. Evaluation of
              program fidelity, adaptations, and sustainability is limited;
              more-systematic examination across population groups and types of
              organizations would help ensure older adults continue to benefit

              and increasing life expectancy, the issue of disability from
              diseases and injuries, and their related interventions, has
              become one of the most important concerns of health-related
              research. METHODS: Using data obtained from the GBD 2015 study,
              the present report provides prevalence and years lived with
              disability (YLDs) of 310 diseases and injuries by sex and age in
              Iran and neighboring countries over the period 1990--2015.
              Age-standardized rates of all causes of YLDs are presented for
              both males and females in 16 countries for 1990 and 2015. We
              present the percentage of total YLDs for 21 categories of
              diseases and injuries, the percentage of YLDs for age groups, as
              well as the ranking of the most prevalent causes and YLDs from
              the top 50 diseases and injuries in Iran. RESULTS: In 2015, the
              burden of 310 diseases and injuries among the Iranian population
              was responsible for 8,357,878 loss of all-age total years, which
              is equal to 10.58\% of total years lived per year. This differs
              from the neighboring countries, as it ranges from 9.05\% in
              Turkmenistan to 13.36\% in Russia. During the past 25 years, a
              remarkable decrease was observed in all-cause YLD rates in all 16
              countries. Meanwhile, in all countries, the age-standardized rate
              of all causes of YLDs was higher in females than males.
              CONCLUSION: Based on our findings, one of the remarkable changes
              in NCDs observed among the studied age groups was increased rate
              of YLDs from mental disorders, which was replaced by
              musculoskeletal disorders in older age groups in 2015.

              increasing prevalence and incidence of diabetes, accompanied by
              large disparities in county-level diabetes prevalence and
              incidence. However, whether these disparities are widening,
              narrowing, or staying the same has not been studied. We examined
              changes in disparity among U.S. counties in diagnosed diabetes
              prevalence and incidence between 2004 and 2012. Methods: We used
              2004 and 2012 county-level diabetes (type 1 and type 2)
              prevalence and incidence data, along with demographic,
              socio-economic, and risk factor data from various sources. To
              determine whether disparities widened or narrowed over the time
              period, we used a regression-based $\beta$-convergence approach,
              accounting for spatial autocorrelation. We calculated diabetes
              prevalence/incidence percentage point (ppt) changes between 2004
              and 2012 and modeled these changes as a function of baseline
              diabetes prevalence/incidence in 2004. Covariates included
              county-level demographic and, socio-economic data, and known type
              2 diabetes risk factors (obesity and leisure-time physical
              inactivity). Results: For each county-level ppt increase in
              diabetes prevalence in 2004 there was an annual average increase
              of 0.02 ppt (p<0.001) in diabetes prevalence between 2004 and
              2012, indicating a widening of disparities. However, after
              accounting for covariates, diabetes prevalence decreased by an
              annual average of 0.04 ppt (p<0.001). In contrast, changes in
              diabetes incidence decreased by an average of 0.04 ppt
              (unadjusted) and 0.09 ppt (adjusted) for each ppt increase in
              diabetes incidence in 2004, indicating a narrowing of
              county-level disparities. Conclusions: County-level disparities
              in diagnosed diabetes prevalence in the United States widened
              between 2004 and 2012, while disparities in incidence narrowed.
              Accounting for demographic and, socio-economic characteristics
              and risk factors for type 2 diabetes narrowed the disparities,
              suggesting that these factors are strongly associated with
              changes in disparities. Public health interventions that target
              modifiable risk factors, such as obesity and physical inactivity,
              in high burden counties might further reduce disparities in
              incidence and, over time, in prevalence. \copyright{} 2016,

               Park. During the study period covering 17 years, we obtained
               information on 536 nests, which shows that Great Bustards used
               the following grassland crop types for breeding: wheat
               (43.07\%), grassland (23.3\%), fallow land (14.45\%) and alfalfa
               (7.67\%). These nests were found during the following
               activities: chemical weed control (33.63\%), hay-cutting
               (25.37\%), disking (8.55\%) and harvesting (7.08\%) and other 18
               types of activities. To identify the effects of disturbance and
               environmental factors on the spatial distribution of nests, such
               as distances to lek sites, roads, settlements and altitude, we
               formulated generalized linear models. As a result, we found that
               nest sites were significantly closer to lek sites and farther

               results may contribute to the understanding of Great Bustard

              Correlates between life style and eye organization have been
              reported in various insect species. Yet, if and how visual
              ecology translates effectively into different visual
              discrimination and learning capabilities has been less explored.
              Here we report results from optical and behavioral analyses
              performed in two sympatric ant species, Formica cunicularia and
              Camponotus aethiops. We show that the former are diurnal while
              the latter are cathemeral. Accordingly, F. cunicularia workers
              present compound eyes with higher resolution, while C. aethiops
              workers exhibit eyes with lower resolution but higher
              sensitivity. The discrimination and learning of visual stimuli
              differs significantly between these species in controlled
              dual-choice experiments: discrimination learning of small-field

  abstract = "Large numbers of bats are killed by wind turbines worldwide and
              minimizing fatalities is critically important to bat conservation
              and acceptance of wind energy development. We implemented a
              2-year study testing the effectiveness of an ultrasonic acoustic
              deterrent for reducing bat fatalities at a wind energy facility
              in Pennsylvania. We randomly selected control and treatment
              turbines that were searched daily in summer and fall 2009 and
              2010. Estimates of fatality, corrected for field biases, were
              compared between treatment and control turbines. In 2009, we
              estimated 21-51\% fewer bats were killed per treatment turbine
              than per control turbine. In 2010, we determined an approximate
              9\% inherent difference between treatment and control turbines
              and when factored into our analysis, variation increased and
              between 2\% more and 64\% fewer bats were killed per treatment
              turbine relative to control turbines. We estimated twice as many
              hoary bats were killed per control turbine than treatment
              turbine, and nearly twice as many silver-haired bats in 2009. In
              2010, although we estimated nearly twice as many hoary bats and
              nearly 4 times as many silver-haired bats killed per control
              turbine than at treatment turbines during the treatment period,
              these only represented an approximate 20\% increase in fatality
              relative to the pre-treatment period for these species when
              accounting for inherent differences between turbine sets. Our
              findings suggest broadband ultrasound broadcasts may reduce bat
              fatalities by discouraging bats from approaching sound sources.
              However, effectiveness of ultrasonic deterrents is limited by
              distance and area ultrasound can be broadcast, in part due to
              rapid attenuation in humid conditions. We caution that an
              operational deterrent device is not yet available and further
              modifications and experimentation are needed. Future efforts must
              also evaluate cost-effectiveness of deterrents in relation to
              curtailment strategies to allow a cost-benefit analysis for
              mitigating bat fatalities.",

  abstract  = "1. Bird--aircraft collisions (bird strikes) represent a
               substantial safety concern and financial burden to civil
               aviation world-wide. Despite an increase in the rate of damaging
               bird strikes, necessary steps to develop a mitigation method
               outside of the airport environment have not been empirically
               tested. 2. We assessed whether use of aircraft lighting might
               enhance detection of and reaction to the approach of an aircraft
               in flight by Canada geese Branta canadensis Linnaeus, a species
               responsible for a high rate of damaging bird strikes. We used a
               novel approach by estimating the visibility to the goose visual
               system of a standard radio-controlled (RC) aircraft (standard
               aircraft) exhibiting either a 2-Hz alternating pulse of two
               lights, or lights off; and another RC aircraft designed to mimic
               a raptor (predator model). We then exposed wing-clipped Canada
               geese to the approach of each aircraft and quantified
               behavioural responses to respective treatments. 3. Estimates of
               chromatic and achromatic contrasts indicated that the standard
               aircraft with lights on was more salient to the visual system of
               the Canada goose than with lights off or the predator model. 4.
               At individual and group levels, quicker alert responses were
               observed to the standard aircraft with lights compared with the
               lights off and predator model. Goose groups showed similar
               responses to approaches by the standard aircraft and the
               predator model, suggesting use of antipredator behaviour to
               avoid the aircraft. 5. Synthesis and applications. Understanding
               animal sensory ecology and associated behaviours can aid the
               development of methods exploiting certain behaviours to reduce
               negative human-- wildlife interactions. For example, reducing
               the frequency of bird strikes requires the integration of
               wildlife management efforts within and outside of the airport
               environment that target species resource use and response to
               disturbance, with mitigation techniques focused on the aircraft.
               Moreover, the design of aircraft lighting systems to enhance
               detection and avoidance by birds is contingent upon
               understanding avian visual ecology and behaviour. Based on
               spectral sensitivity in Canada geese, aircraft-mounted lights
               that peak in the ultraviolet ⁄ violet range (380--400 nm) are
               likely to produce the maximal behavioural effect.",

              identified a synergy between the anthelmintic albendazole (ABZ)
              and drugs depleting the filarial endosymbiont Wolbachia, a proven
              macrofilaricide target, which reduces treatment from several
              weeks to 7 days in preclinical models. ABZ had negligible effects
              on Wolbachia but synergized with minocycline or rifampicin (RIF)
              to deplete symbionts, block embryogenesis, and stop microfilariae
              production. Greater than 99\% Wolbachia depletion following 7-day
              combination of RIF+ABZ also led to accelerated macrofilaricidal
              activity. Thus, we provide preclinical proof-of-concept of
              treatment shortening using antibiotic+ABZ combinations to deliver
              anti-Wolbachia sterilizing and macrofilaricidal effects. Our data

              anti-Wolbachia drugs under development may be capable of
              delivering further treatment shortening, to days rather than
              weeks, if combined with benzimidazoles. \copyright{} 2017,

  abstract = "In this paper, we combine ideas from machine learning (ML) and
              operations research and management science (OR/MS) in developing
              a framework, along with specific methods, for using data to
              prescribe optimal decisions in OR/MS problems. In a departure
              from other work on data-driven optimization and reflecting our
              practical experience with the data available in applications of
              OR/MS, we consider data consisting, not only of observations of
              quantities with direct effect on costs/revenues, such as demand
              or returns, but predominantly of observations of associated
              auxiliary quantities. The main problem of interest is a
              conditional stochastic optimization problem, given imperfect
              observations, where the joint probability distributions that
              specify the problem are unknown. We demonstrate that our proposed
              solution methods, which are inspired by ML methods such as local
              regression, CART, and random forests, are generally applicable to
              a wide range of decision problems. We prove that they are
              tractable and asymptotically optimal even when data is not iid
              and may be censored. We extend this to the case where decision
              variables may directly affect uncertainty in unknown ways, such
              as pricing's effect on demand. As an analogue to R^2, we develop
              a metric P termed the coefficient of prescriptiveness to measure
              the prescriptive content of data and the efficacy of a policy
              from an operations perspective. To demonstrate the power of our
              approach in a real-world setting we study an inventory management
              problem faced by the distribution arm of an international media
              conglomerate, which ships an average of 1bil units per year. We
              leverage internal data and public online data harvested from
              IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Google to prescribe operational
              decisions that outperform baseline measures. Specifically, the
              data we collect, leveraged by our methods, accounts for an 88\%
              improvement as measured by our P.",

  author   = "Malambo, P and Kengne, A P and De Villiers, A and Lambert, E V

  abstract = "Introduction Built environment attributes have been linked to
              cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Therefore, identifying built
              environment attributes that are associated with CVD risk is
              relevant for facilitating effective public health interventions.
              Objective To conduct a systematic review of literature to examine
              the influence of built environmental attributes on CVD risks.
              Data Source Multiple database searches including Science direct,
              CINAHL, Masterfile Premier, EBSCO and manual scan of reference
              lists were conducted. Inclusion Criteria Studies published in
              English between 2005 and April 2015 were included if they
              assessed one or more of the neighborhood environmental attributes
              in relation with any major CVD outcomes and selected risk factors
              among adults. Data Extraction Author(s), country/city, sex, age,
              sample size, study design, tool used to measure neighborhood
              environment, exposure and outcome assessments and associations
              were extracted from eligible studies. Results Eighteen studies
              met the inclusion criteria. Most studies used both
              cross-sectional design and Geographic Information System (GIS) to
              assess the neighborhood environmental attributes. Neighborhood
              environmental attributes were significantly associated with CVD
              risk and CVD outcomes in the expected direction. Residential
              density, safety from traffic, recreation facilities, street
              connectivity and high walkable environment were associated with
              physical activity. High walkable environment, fast food
              restaurants, supermarket/grocery stores were associated with
              blood pressure, body mass index, diabetes mellitus and metabolic
              syndrome. High density traffic, road proximity and fast food
              restaurants were associated with CVDs outcomes. Conclusion This
              study confirms the relationship between neighborhood environment
              attributes and CVDs and risk factors. Prevention programs should
              account for neighborhood environmental attributes in the
              communities where people live. \copyright{} 2016 Malambo et

  abstract = "Several studies have demonstrated that point-of-choice prompts
              modestly increase stair use (i.e., incidental physical activity)
              in many public places, but evidence of effectiveness in airport
              settings is weak. Furthermore, evaluating the effects of past
              physical activity on stair use and on point-of-choice prompts to
              increase stair use is lacking. The purpose of this study was to
              evaluate the influence of sign prompts and participant factors
              including past physical activity on stair ascent in an airport
              setting. We used a quasi-experimental design, systematically
              introducing and removing sign prompts daily across 22 days at the
              San Diego International Airport. Intercept interviewers recruited
              stair and escalator ascenders (N = 1091; 33.0\% interview refusal
              rate) of the only stairs/escalators providing access to Terminal
              1 from the parking lot. A 13-item questionnaire about
              demographics, physical activity, health behavior, and contextual
              factors provided data not available in nearly all other stair use
              studies. We examined the effects of signs and self-reported
              covariates using multivariable logistic regression analyses, and
              tested whether physical activity and other covariates modified
              the intervention effect. Adjusting for all significant
              covariates, prompts increased the odds of stair use (odds ratio
              3.67; p < .001). Past participation in vigorous physical activity
              increased the odds of stair use by 1.62 (p = 0.001). None of the
              covariates moderated the intervention effect. In conclusion,
              vigorous physical activity and correlates of physical activity
              were related to stair use in expected directions, but did not
              modify the effect of the intervention. This indicates that the
              effects of point-of-choice prompts are independent of past
              physical activity, making them effective interventions for active
              adults and the higher risk population of inactive adults. Signs
              can prompt stair use in an airport setting and might be employed
              at most public stairs to increase rates of incidental physical
              activity and contribute to overall improvements in population
              health. \copyright{} 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",

              a straight forward easy modelling. Nevertheless, insights can
              also be gained by exploring weakly dependent covariates paying
              attention to details of the distribution. Using the concept of
              copulas, it is possible to explore the dependence of a
              multivariate distribution without the distortion of the marginal
              distribution functions acting on typical correlation measures.
              Furthermore, copulas turn the attention to the dependence across
              the entire range of the multivariate distribution and do not only
              summarise it in a single correlation measure. In our application,
              we study counts of rat sightings in the city of Madrid. The brown
              rat lives with mankind and adversely affects public health by
              transmission of diseases, bites and allergies. Better
              understanding behavioural and spatial correlation aspects of this
              species can contribute to its effective management and control.
              We explore weakly to moderately correlated covariates based on
              distances to broken sewers, feeding grounds and markets as well
              as population density. The use of copulas is motivated by the
              different dependence structures of the four covariates and the
              asymmetries therein. In order to deal with the discrete
              zero-inflated counts, we present a new approach that assigns

              underlying continuous variable easing the vine copula estimation,
              but do not destroy the dependence as in a uniform randomisation.
              We show that a 5-dimensional vine copula model is able to capture
              the dependence in our application. \copyright{} 2017, Springer

              barriers and facilitators towards the initiation of conversation
              on this topic. A qualitative study design involving
              semi-structured focus group discussions (FGDs) was conducted with
              19 family medicine trainees in Malaysia. The conceptual framework
              used was based on the Theory of Planned Behavior. Thematic
              approach was used to analyze the data. Participants perceived FSD
              as being uncommon and unimportant. According to our participants,
              patients often presented with indirect complaints, and doctors
              were not proactive in asking about FSD. Three main barriers were
              identified: doctor factors, perceived patient factors, and system
              factors. Lack of confidence, knowledge, experience, time, and
              embarrassment were the key barriers identified at the doctors'
              level. Lack of awareness, among patients regarding FSD, and local
              cultural and religious norms were the perceived patient barriers.
              System barriers were lack of time and privacy. Various
              facilitators, such as continuous medical education and public
              forums, were suggested as means to encourage family medicine
              trainees to initiate discussion on sexual matters during
              consultations. In conclusion, family medicine trainees found it
              difficult to initiate conversation on FSD with patients.

              and other identified barriers. {\^A}\copyright{} 2016, Springer

              Lipid and Glucose Study in 2009 - 2012. FIGO terminology and
              previous definitions were used for classification of AUB.
              Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios
              (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals to check the association
              between AUB and the women's demographic characteristics. P < 0.05
              was considered statistically significant. Results: A total of
              35.8\% (95\% CI: 31.5\% - 40.2\%) of the participants suffered
              from one or more types of AUB. About 10.6\% (95\% CI: 6.3\% -
              12.5\%) of them had disturbances of regularity and 23.8\% (95\%
              CI: 18.4\% - 26.1\%) reported experiencing disturbances of
              frequency. Also, disturbances of heaviness of flow and duration

              11.5\% (95\% CI: 8\% - 15.4\%), respectively. About 4.3\% of the
              women (95\% CI: 2.1\% - 10.5\%) reported irregular non-menstrual

              respectively. In addition, the proportions of women with AUB rose
              in the early and late reproductive years. After adjustment of
              confounders, logistic regression analysis showed that age
              (adjusted OR = 1.08, 95\% CI: 1.07 - 3.97, P = 0.03) and BMI

              Lymphocytic Leukemia: A Systematic Review of the Literature",
  author   = "Frey, S and Blankart, C R and Stargardt, T",
  abstract = "Background: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most
              prevalent type of leukemia in the Western hemisphere. The disease
              affects quality of life (QOL) and poses an economic burden on
              patients, payers, and society. The objective of this review was
              to quantify the economic burden and quality-of-life effects and
              identify the gaps that should be addressed by future research.
              Methods: Free-text and subject heading searches in MEDLINE,
              EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the University of York Centre for
              Reviews and Dissemination Database, and the Web of Science Core
              Collection database were conducted to identify observational and
              interventional studies reporting costs and/or quality-of-life
              effects published up to 2 October 2015. Studies were included
              irrespective of whether they were conducted prospectively or
              retrospectively. The focus population consisted of adult patients
              aged 18 years or older affected by any stage of CLL. Studies were
              included regardless of whether the underlying population was
              treated at baseline or not. Risk of bias was assessed using a
              quality checklist developed by the Effective Public Health
              Practice Project for (randomized) controlled trials, cohort
              studies, and cross-sectional studies. Economic evaluations were
              rated using a checklist developed by Stuhldreher et al. (Int J
              Eat Disord 45:476--91, 2012). Results: From 2451 records
              identified, 27 studies were found to be eligible for inclusion.
              Studies were heterogeneous with respect to methodology,
              perspective, and data used. Annual direct costs per person ranged
              from US\$4491 in Germany to US\$43,913 in the USA. The share of
              costs attributable to drug treatment varied between 26.2 and 79
              \%. Indirect costs amounted to US\$4208. Severity of disease was
              a predictor for quality of life, whereas differences by age and
              sex were mainly present in subdomains. Comparisons of treated and
              untreated populations resulted in an increase of quality of life
              in favor of treated populations in the long-term perspective.
              Differences between treatments were small. Consequently, cost
              effectiveness in decision--analytic models did not depend on
              whether quality of life or survival are used to describe the
              benefits of treatment. Conclusions: Although the quantity and the
              quality of health economic and quality-of-life evidence have
              substantially increased, there is still a need for studies that
              take a patient or societal perspective. Factors that influence
              costs and the quality of life of patients seem to be
              well-established, while longitudinal lifetime cost studies at the
              population level are still scarce. \copyright{} 2015, Springer

              the epidemiology of skin diseases in the aged is lacking. Methods
              A systematic review was conducted including electronic database
              searches in MEDLINE, Embase, SCOPUS and Web of Science. The
              eligibility criteria were primary incidence and prevalence
              studies or secondary data analysis, English or German language,
              subjects being 65+ years and reported skin problems or diseases.
              Data extraction was conducted using a standardized data
              collection form and the methodological quality of included
              studies was assessed. Results After screening of 1491 records, 74
              records were included reporting data for more than 20 skin
              conditions. The majority of prevalence and incidence figures was
              identified for hospital and long-term care settings. The most
              prevalent skin diseases were fungal infections (14.3\%--64\%),
              dermatitis (1\%--58.7\%), xerosis (5.4\%--85.5\%) and benign skin
              tumors (1.7\%--74.5\%). Additionally, pressure ulcer prevalence
              ranged from 0.3\% to 46\% and incidence from 0.8\% to 34\%.
              Conclusion Skin conditions and diseases in aged populations are
              frequent. Health care practitioners should pay attention to
              those, although skin conditions might not be the primary reason
              for seeking care. Epidemiological data are lacking especially for
              home care and community settings although this can be regarded as
              the most important from a public health and prevention point of
              view. The methodological quality and reporting of epidemiological
              studies in the aged populations must be improved. Systematic

              exponential growth human population and medical expenses. It is
              well known that an effective health monitoring system can detect
              abnormalities of health conditions in time and make diagnoses
              according to the gleaned data. As a vital approach to diagnose
              heart diseases, ECG monitoring is widely studied and applied.
              However, nearly all existing portable ECG monitoring systems
              cannot work without a mobile application, which is responsible
              for data collection and display. In this paper, we propose a new
              method for ECG monitoring based on Internet-of-Things (IoT)
              techniques. ECG data are gathered using a wearable monitoring
              node and are transmitted directly to the IoT cloud using Wi-Fi.
              Both the HTTP and MQTT protocols are employed in the IoT cloud in
              order to provide visual and timely ECG data to users. Nearly all
              smart terminals with a web browser can acquire ECG data
              conveniently, which has greatly alleviated the cross-platform
              issue. Experiments are carried out on healthy volunteers in order
              to verify the reliability of the entire system. Experimental
              results reveal that the proposed system is reliable in collecting
              and displaying real-time ECG data, which can aid in the primary
              diagnosis of certain heart diseases. \copyright{} 2016, Springer

  abstract = "Molecular pathological epidemiology (MPE) is an integrative field
              that utilizes molecular pathology to incorporate interpersonal
              heterogeneity of a disease process into epidemiology. In each
              individual, the development and progression of a disease are
              determined by a unique combination of exogenous and endogenous
              factors, resulting in different molecular and pathological
              subtypes of the disease. Based on ``the unique disease
              principle,'' the primary aim of MPE is to uncover an interactive
              relationship between a specific environmental exposure and
              disease subtypes in determining disease incidence and mortality.
              This MPE approach can provide etiologic and pathogenic insights,
              potentially contributing to precision medicine for personalized
              prevention and treatment. Although breast, prostate, lung, and
              colorectal cancers have been among the most commonly studied
              diseases, the MPE approach can be used to study any disease. In
              addition to molecular features, host immune status and microbiome
              profile likely affect a disease process, and thus serve as
              informative biomarkers. As such, further integration of several
              disciplines into MPE has been achieved (e.g., pharmaco-MPE,
              immuno-MPE, and microbial MPE), to provide novel insights into
              underlying etiologic mechanisms. With the advent of
              high-throughput sequencing technologies, available genomic and
              epigenomic data have expanded dramatically. The MPE approach can
              also provide a specific risk estimate for each disease subgroup,

              males and 57 were females. Thirty-five percent were aware of the
              essential medical list (EML), among them 11\% were from oral
              medicine and radiology and 6.7\% were from pedodontics. However,
              most of them were unaware of the number of fixed dose combination
              drugs present in the World Health Organization EML. None of them
              were able to name at least a single banned fixed dose combination
              drug. Most of them were unaware of the advantages and
              disadvantages of using fixed dose combination drugs. Amoxicillin
              with clavulanic acid was the most common drug prescribed by
              students (73.3\%) followed by ofloxacin with ornidazole (54.4\%),
              ibuprofen with paracetamol (53.3\%), and sulfamethoxazole with
              trimethoprim (6\%). Most of them were unaware of the rationality
              in using fixed dose combination drugs. Common sources of
              information were medical representatives 43 (47.8\%), internet 39
              (43.3\%), and 12 (13.3\%) reported using WHO EML. Conclusion:
              There is an urgent need to improve knowledge on the rationality
              for using fixed dose combination, EML, and banned fixed dose
              combination in India to the promote rational use of fixed dose
              combination. \copyright{} 2016 Journal of International Society

              six subthemes: I) Involving whom and why, with four subthemes of
              i) Addressing justice, ii) Generating ownership, iii) Developing
              trust and a feeling of togetherness, and iv) Concretizing the

              the paper was to evaluate the significance of the obituary tables
              for the development of the Cuban mortality statistics. A
              descriptive study based on the historical method was conducted. A
              number of original documents from the archives of the Center of
              Historical and Science Organization Studies, the National

              on reaching diagnostic resolution at specific time points after
              an abnormal breast cancer screening test among a national sample.
              A prospective meta-analysis estimated the adjusted odds of
              achieving timely diagnostic resolution at 60, 180, and 365 days.
              Exploratory analyses were conducted on the pooled sample to
              identify which groups had the most benefit from navigation.
              Clinics from six medical centers serving vulnerable populations
              participated in the Patient Navigation Research Program. Women
              with an abnormal breast cancer screening test between 2007 and
              2009 were included and received the patient navigation
              intervention or usual care. Patient navigators worked with
              patients and their care providers to address patient-specific
              barriers to care to prevent delays in diagnosis. A total of 4675
              participants included predominantly racial/ethnic minorities (74
              \%) with public insurance (40 \%) or no insurance (31 \%). At 60
              days and 180 days, there was no statistically significant effect
              of navigation on achieving timely diagnostic care, but a benefit
              of navigation was seen at 365 days (aOR 2.12, CI 1.36--3.29). We
              found an equal benefit of navigation across all groups,
              regardless of race/ethnicity, language, insurance status, and

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) is a common
              harmful traditional practice in many communities in Africa and to
              a lesser extent in Middle East and other regions in the world. In
              order to better understand publishing on this topic, we conducted
              a bibliometric study on FGM/C. Bibliometric analyses can be used
              as an indicator of the extent of interaction of researchers,
              health authorities, and communities with a particular health
              issue. METHODS: Scopus database was used to retrieve data on
              FGM/C. Keywords used were ``female genital mutilation'', ``female
              genital circumcision'', ``female genital cutting'' and ``female
              circumcision''. Specifically, the number of publications, top
              productive countries and institutions, highly cited articles,
              citation analysis, co-authorships, international collaboration,
              role of African countries, top active authors, and journals
              involved in publishing articles on FGM/C were reviewed and
              analyzed. We indirectly assessed the impact of publications using
              total number of citations received, average number of citations
              per article, Hirsch-index, percentage of highly cited articles,
              and journal's impact factor. RESULTS: One thousand and
              thirty-five publications on FGM/C were retrieved. The h-index of
              retrieved articles was 37. A steep rise in number of publications
              was noticed in mid-1990s and again in 2012. More than half of
              retrieved articles were published from 2006 - 2015. A total of 65
              countries contributed. The top ten productive countries included
              ones from Northern America, Europe and Africa. Nigeria and Egypt
              were the most active African countries in FGM/C publications. At
              least nine African academic institutions were actively involved
              on FGM/C publications. Articles on FGM/C that received the
              highest number of citations were those that focused on negative
              physical and psychosexual consequences of FGM/C. Journal topic
              areas were obstetrics/gynecology, public health, and
              psychological sociology. Collaboration between African and
              European countries on FGM/C research was evident. CONCLUSION:
              Bibliometric analysis reveals that research publications on FGM/C
              have been increasing since the l970s, with collaboration between
              African and Western countries, and articles are being published
              in higher impact journals, not only obstetrics, but also public
              health and social sciences. FGM/C research can be helpful to
              international health agencies and governments not only to
              document negative outcomes, but also to identify best practices,
              and to note gaps in implementation and practice.",

              annual Health Assessment between the years 2009--2015 tested
              research aims. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) (n = 10,165)
              tested the latent structure of the 8-item WLQ. Scale reliability
              was determined using a CFA-based approach while test--retest
              reliability was determined using the intraclass correlation
              coefficient. Convergent/discriminant validity was tested by
              evaluating relations between the 8-item WLQ with
              health/performance variables for convergent validity
              (health-related work performance, number of chronic conditions,
              and general health) and demographic variables for discriminant
              validity (gender and institution type). Results A 1-factor model
              with three correlated residuals demonstrated excellent model fit
              (CFI = 0.99, TLI = 0.99, RMSEA = 0.03, and SRMR = 0.01). The
              scale reliability was acceptable (0.69, 95\% CI 0.68--0.70) and
              the test--retest reliability was very good (ICC = 0.78).
              Low-to-moderate associations were observed between the 8-item WLQ
              and the health/performance variables while weak associations were
              observed between the demographic variables. Conclusions The
              8-item WLQ demonstrated sufficient reliability and validity among
              employees from a public university system. Results suggest the
              8-item WLQ is a usable alternative for studies when the more

              data Resource platform were introduced including its components,
              framework, elements and two implementations. OSCAR provides a
              data resource aggregation platform to retrieve data from official
              statistic agencies through data service and database, scrawl
              related data from BBS and social media and mirror the environment

              arranged in data cubes according to their spatial and temporal
              dimensions. This mechanism ensures the feasibility and timeliness
              of time-sequence analysis of specific regions. The algorithms of

              The computation ability can be extended on-demand and thus the
              time of the computation can be shortened and limited in several

              connecting ancestry and health. For instance, data on genome-wide
              ancestry informative markers are being used to assess health
              risks, and we document over 100 biomedical research articles that
              propose associations between mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosome
              markers of genetic ancestry and a wide variety of disease risks.
              Taking as an example an association between coronary heart
              disease and British men belonging to Y chromosome haplogroup I,
              we show how this science was translated into mainstream and
              online media, and how it circulates among consumers of genetic
              tests for ancestry. We find wide variations in how the science is
              interpreted, which suggests the potential for confusion or
              misunderstanding. Conclusion: We recommend that stakeholders
              involved in creating and using estimates of genetic ancestry
              reconsider their policies for communicating with each other and
              with the public about the health implications of ancestry

  abstract = "Air pollution with various materials, particularly with aerosols,
              increases with the advances in technological development. This is
              a complicated global problem. One of the priorities in achieving
              sustainable development is the reduction of harmful technological
              effects on the environment and human health. It is a
              responsibility of researchers to search for effective methods of
              reducing pollution. The reliable results can be obtained by
              combining the approaches used in various fields of science and
              technology. This paper aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of
              the multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) methods in
              investigating and solving the environmental pollution problems.
              The paper presents the study of the process of the evaporation of
              a toxic liquid based on using the MADM methods. A schematic view
              of the test setup is presented. The density, viscosity, and rate
              of the released vapor flow are measured and the dependence of the
              variation of the solution concentration on its temperature is
              determined in the experimental study. The concentration of
              hydrochloric acid solution (HAS) varies in the range from 28\% to
              34\%, while the liquid is heated from 50 to 80 °C. The variations
              in the parameters are analyzed using the well-known VIKOR and
              COPRAS MADM methods. For determining the criteria weights, a new
              CILOS (Criterion Impact LOSs) method is used. The experimental
              results are arranged in the priority order, using the MADM
              methods. Based on the obtained data, the technological parameters
              of production, ensuring minimum environmental pollution, can be
              chosen. \copyright{} 2016 by the authors.",

              life, there is limited updated evidence on oral health status in
              Limpopo province. Objectives: To determine the epidemiological
              profile of patients utilising public oral health services in
              Limpopo province. Method: This was a descriptive retrospective
              clinical chart review conducted in five purposively selected
              district hospitals in Limpopo province. The collected data
              included the patient's sociodemographic information, reasons for
              dental consultation, information on the dental or oral diseases
              and the treatment received. Five hundred clinical files were
              systematically selected (100 from each district hospital) for the
              period 01 January 1995 to 31 December 2013. Data were collected
              using the World Health Organization's indicator age groups,
              namely 6-year-olds, 12-year-olds, 18-year-olds and 35-44-year-old
              groups. A data capturing sheet was used to record the collected
              information. Data were analysed using the statistical software
              package for social sciences SPSS version 23.0. Results: The
              majority of patients were in the age group of 6 to 20 years (n =
              375, 75\%). The majority were male patients (n = 309; 62\%).
              Dental caries was the most common complaint (n = 298, 60\%). The
              second most common main complaint in this age group was retained
              primary or deciduous teeth (n = 60, 12\%) affecting children
              mainly in the age group of 6 to 12 years. The most common
              clinical procedure across all five districts was dental
              extractions (n = 324, 64\%). Other clinical interventions
              included scaling and polishing (n = 33, 12\%) and dental
              restorative care (n = 20, 3\%). Conclusion: There is an urgent

              who are most likely to witness an out of hospital cardiac arrest

              providing BLS training to family members of high-risk cardiac
              patients. Methods: A search of Ovid MEDLINE, CINAL, EMBASE,
              Informit, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, ERIC and
              ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global was conducted. We
              included all studies training adult family members of high-risk
              cardiac patients regardless of methods used for cardiopulmonary
              resuscitation (CPR) or BLS training. Two reviewers independently
              extracted data and evaluated the quality of evidence using GRADE
              (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and
              Evaluation). Results: We included 26 of the 1172 studies
              identified. The majority of studies were non-randomised
              controlled trials (n = 18), of very low to moderate quality.
              Currently, there is insufficient evidence to indicate a benefit
              of this intervention for patients; largely because of low numbers
              of OHCA events and high loss to follow-up. However, the majority
              of trained individuals were able to competently perform BLS
              skills, reported a willingness to use these skills and
              experienced lower anxiety. Conclusion: Whilst there is no current
              evidence for improvement in patient outcomes from targeted BLS
              training for family members, this group are willing and capable
              to learn these skills. Future research may need to examine longer
              periods of follow-up using alternate methods (e.g. cardiac arrest

              implement prevention strategies, and justify allocation of
              resources toward research, education, and rehabilitation in TBI.
              There is not, to our knowledge, a systematic review of
              population-based studies addressing the epidemiology of TBI that
              includes all subtypes. We performed a comprehensive systematic
              review and meta-analysis of the worldwide incidence of TBI.
              Methods: A search was conducted on May 23, 2014, in Medline and
              EMBASE according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
              Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Abstracts were screened
              independently and in duplicate to identify original research.
              Study quality and ascertainment bias were assessed in duplicate
              using a previously published tool. Demographic data and incidence
              estimates from each study were recorded, along with
              stratification by age, gender, year of data collection, and
              severity. Results: The search strategy yielded 4944 citations.
              Two hundred and sixteen articles met criteria for full-text
              review; 144 were excluded. Hand searching resulted in ten
              additional articles. Eighty-two studies met all eligibility
              criteria. The pooled annual incidence proportion for all ages was
              295 per 100,000 (95\% confidence interval: 274-317). The pooled
              incidence rate for all ages was 349 (95\% confidence interval:
              96.2-1266) per 100,000 person-years. Incidence proportion and
              incidence rate were examined to see if associated with age, sex,
              country, or severity. Conclusions: We conclude that most TBIs are
              mild and most TBIs occur in males among the adult population. The
              incidence of TBI varies widely by ages and between countries.
              Despite being an important medical, economic, and social problem,
              the global epidemiology of TBI is still not well-characterized in
              the current literature. Understanding the incidence of TBI,
              particularly mild TBI, remains challenging because of
              nonstandardized reporting among neuroepidemiological studies.

              avian influenza outbreaks from 2010 to 2016 exists. Methods: Data
              was collated from four databases (Scopus, Web of Science Core
              Correlation, PubMed and SpringerLink electronic journal) and a
              global electronic reporting system (ProMED mail), using PRISMA

              influenza virus outbreaks were identified and included in this
              review, alongside 198 ProMED mail reports. Results: Our research
              identified that the majority of the reported outbreaks occurred
              in 2016 (22.2\%). These outbreaks were located in China (13.6\%)

              influenza virus has been proved to be able to contaminate all

  abstract = "Background As reimbursement authorities are gaining greater power
              to influence the prescription behavior of physicians, it remains
              critical for life science companies focusing on personalized
              medicine to develop ``tailor-made'' payer engagement strategies
              to secure reimbursement and assure timely patient access to their
              innovative products. Depending on the types of such engagement,
              pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies may benefit by obtaining
              access to medical and pharmacy claims data, getting invaluable
              upfront inputs on evidence requirements and clinical trial
              design, and strengthening trust by payers, therefore avoiding
              uncertainties with regards to pricing, reimbursement, and
              research and development reinvestment. This article aims to study
              the evolving trend of partnering among two interdependent, yet
              confronting, stakeholder groups-payers and producers-as well as
              to identify the most promising payer engagement strategies based
              on cocreation of value introduced by life science companies in
              the past few years. We analyzed the recent case studies from both
              therapeutic and diagnostic realms considered as the ``best
              practices'' in payer engagement. The last 5 years were a breakout
              period for deals between life science companies and reimbursement
              authorities in the area of personalized medicine with a number of
              felicitous collaborative practices established already, and many
              more yet to emerge. We suggest that there are many ways for
              producers and payers to collaborate throughout the product life
              cycle-from data exchange and scientific counseling to research
              collaboration aimed at reducing healthcare costs, addressing
              adherence issues, and diminishing risks associated with future
              launches. Conclusions The presented case studies provide clear
              insights on how successful personalized medicine companies
              customize their state-of-the-art payer engagement strategies to
              ensure closer proximity with payers and establish longer-term

  abstract = "The ideal spatial scale, or granularity, at which infectious
              disease incidence should be monitored and forecast has been
              little explored. By identifying the optimal granularity for a
              given disease and host population, and matching surveillance and
              prediction efforts to this scale, response to emergent and
              recurrent outbreaks can be improved. Here we explore how
              granularity and representation of spatial structure affect
              influenza forecast accuracy within New York City. We develop
              network models at the borough and neighborhood levels, and use
              them in conjunction with surveillance data and a data
              assimilation method to forecast influenza activity. These
              forecasts are compared to an alternate system that predicts
              influenza for each borough or neighborhood in isolation. At the
              borough scale, influenza epidemics are highly synchronous despite
              substantial differences in intensity, and inclusion of network
              connectivity among boroughs generally improves forecast accuracy.
              At the neighborhood scale, we observe much greater spatial
              heterogeneity among influenza outbreaks including substantial
              differences in local outbreak timing and structure; however,
              inclusion of the network model structure generally degrades
              forecast accuracy. One notable exception is that local outbreak
              onset, particularly when signal is modest, is better predicted
              with the network model. These findings suggest that observation
              and forecast at sub-municipal scales within New York City
              provides richer, more discriminant information on influenza
              incidence, particularly at the neighborhood scale where greater
              heterogeneity exists, and that the spatial spread of influenza
              among localities can be forecast. \copyright{} 2016 Public

              adolescents; and contain in the results the answer to the guiding
              question. The exclusion criterion were studies that were not
              consistent with the objective of the integrative review. Data
              Synthesis: 18 studies were found, which identified external
              causes as the main reasons for attending adolescents related to
              traffic accidents, violence, suicide attempt and injuries during
              leisure and sports practices. Conclusion: The main causes of care
              are due to avoidable causes, which can be combated with
              socio-educational public policy measures, focusing on health
              promotion practices and disease prevention. \copyright{} 2017,

  abstract = "Background: Mortality from TB continues to be a global public
              health challenge. TB ranks alongside Human Immunodeficiency Virus
              (HIV) as the leading infectious causes of death globally. HIV is
              a major driver of TB related morbidity and mortality while TB is
              the leading cause of mortality among people living with HIV/AIDS.
              We sought to determine excess mortality associated with HIV and
              the effect of antiretroviral therapy on reducing mortality among
              tuberculosis patients in Kenya. Methods: We conducted a
              retrospective analysis of Kenya national tuberculosis program
              data of patients enrolled from 2013 through 2014. We used direct
              standardization to obtain standardized mortality ratios for
              tuberculosis patients compared with the general population. We
              calculated the population attributable fraction of tuberculosis
              deaths due to HIV based on the standardized mortality ratio for
              deaths among TB patients with HIV compared to TB patients without
              HIV. We used Cox proportional hazards regression for assessing
              risk factors for mortality. Results: Of 162,014 patients included
              in the analysis, 6\% died. Mortality was 10.6 (95\% CI:
              10.4--10.8) times higher among TB patients than the general
              population; 42\% of deaths were attributable to HIV infection.
              Patients with HIV who were not receiving ART had an over
              four-fold risk of death compared to patients without HIV (aHR =
              4.2, 95\% CI 3.9--4.6). In contrast, patients with HIV who were
              receiving ART had only 2.6 times the risk of death (aHR = 2.6,
              95\% CI 2.5--2.7). Conclusion: HIV was a significant contributor
              to TB-associated deaths in Kenya. Mortality among HIV-infected
              individuals was higher among those not on ART than those on ART.
              Early initiation of ART among HIV infected people (a ``test and
              treat'' approach) should further reduce TB-associated deaths.

               dimorphism (SSD) and dietary overlap are not well understood in
               birds. We analyzed differences between the sexes in diet
               composition, dietary diversity, diet selection, and volume and
               density of droppings, as well as the dietary overlap between
               sexes, in the Great Bustard (Otis tarda), the species showing
               the highest SSD among birds. We discuss the differences that we
               found in relation to various predictions derived from ecological
               and physiological differences between the sexes, under the
               hypothesis that these differences are ultimately determined by
               the strong SSD of this species. As expected, our best linear
               mixed-effects food selection models included sex as a main
               factor explaining differences in diet composition and dietary
               diversity of Great Bustards throughout the annual cycle. Both
               sexes were mostly herbivorous, consuming legumes when they were
               available. Males consumed fewer arthropods, but of significantly
               larger size, than females. The droppings of males were larger,
               heavier, and slightly denser than those of females. Males showed
               higher dietary diversity than females, except during the
               postmating season. The mean dietary overlap between the sexes
               was 0.7, one of the smallest values among birds. Overall, our
               results suggest that the species' extreme SSD along with the
               distinct reproductive role of each sex might explain the trophic
               niche divergence in the Great Bustard.",

              the management and governance of this issue, including why these

              conducted a content analysis of 405 newspaper articles (81 had

              States, including the presentation of the risks/safety and

  abstract = "The fight against infectious diseases is probably one of the
              greatest public health challenges faced by our society,
              especially with the emergence of carbapenem-resistant
              gram-negatives that are in some cases pan-drug resistant.
              Currently, $\beta$-lactamase-mediated resistance does not spare
              even the newest and most powerful $\beta$-lactams (carbapenems),
              whose activity is challenged by carbapenemases. The worldwide
              dissemination of carbapenemases in gram-negative organisms
              threatens to take medicine back into the pre-antibiotic era since
              the mortality associated with infections caused by these
              ``superbugs'' is very high, due to limited treatment options.
              Clinically-relevant carbapenemases belong either to metallo-
              $\beta$- lactamases (MBLs) of Ambler class B or to serine-$\beta$
              -lactamases (SBLs) of Ambler class A and D enzymes. Class A
              carbapenemases may be chromosomally-encoded (SME, NmcA, SFC-1,
              BIC-1, PenA, FPH-1, SHV-38), plasmid-encoded (KPC, GES, FRI-1) or
              both (IMI). The plasmid-encoded enzymes are often associated with
              mobile elements responsible for their mobilization. These
              enzymes, even though weakly related in terms of sequence
              identities, share structural features and a common mechanism of
              action. They variably hydrolyse penicillins, cephalosporins,
              monobactams, carbapenems, and are inhibited by clavulanate and
              tazobactam. Three-dimensional structures of class A
              carbapenemases, in the apo form or in complex with
              substrates/inhibitors, together with site-directed mutagenesis
              studies, provide essential input for identifying the structural
              factors and subtle conformational changes that influence the
              hydrolytic profile and inhibition of these enzymes. Overall,
              these data represent the building blocks for understanding the
              structure-function relationships that define the phenotypes of
              class A carbapenemases and can guide the design of new molecules

              scientists trying to secure a response to the problems and
              solutions they raise and identifying the need for better evidence
              to reduce policymaker uncertainty. We offer a new perspective by
              using policy theory to propose research with greater impact,
              identifying the need to use persuasion to reduce ambiguity, and
              to adapt to multi-level policymaking systems. We identify
              insights from secondary data, namely systematic reviews, critical
              analysis and policy theories relevant to evidence-based
              policymaking. The studies are drawn primarily from countries such
              as the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New
              Zealand. We combine empirical and normative elements to identify
              the ways in which scientists can, do and could influence policy.
              We identify two important dilemmas, for scientists and
              researchers, that arise from our initial advice. First, effective
              actors combine evidence with manipulative emotional appeals to
              influence the policy agenda - should scientists do the same, or
              would the reputational costs outweigh the policy benefits?
              Second, when adapting to multi-level policymaking, should
              scientists prioritise 'evidence-based' policymaking above other
              factors? The latter includes governance principles such the
              'co-production' of policy between local public bodies, interest
              groups and service users. This process may be based primarily on
              values and involve actors with no commitment to a hierarchy of
              evidence. We conclude that successful engagement in
              'evidence-based policymaking' requires pragmatism, combining
              scientific evidence with governance principles, and persuasion to
              translate complex evidence into simple stories. To maximise the
              use of scientific evidence in health and public health policy,
              researchers should recognise the tendency of policymakers to base
              judgements on their beliefs, and shortcuts based on their
              emotions and familiarity with information; learn 'where the
              action is', and be prepared to engage in long-term strategies to
              be able to influence policy; and, in both cases, decide how far
              you are willing to go to persuade policymakers to act and secure
              a hierarchy of evidence underpinning policy. These are
              value-driven and political, not just 'evidence-based', choices.

              leap found the medical community and society unprepared to deal

              surgical procedure that was striving to transition from sci-fi
              novels to science. Today, 10 years and over 35 transplants later,
              public opinion has become accustomed to the concept of ``face
              restoration'' through transplantation. However, face
              transplantation is far from being a safe ``routine'' surgery and
              the science behind it is still mostly unknown. Patients and
              multidisciplinary teams of physicians confront daily medical
              challenges, life-threatening risks, and personal struggle that
              only in part come to light. Could (or should) this be the
              laborious, uncertain, and high-risk trajectory of disruptive

              discoveries and surgical advancements in the field have been

              ethical discussions, and meaningful changes in social beliefs

              results showed factors such as being a boy (OR = 8.9 (7.9 -
              10.0)), having a positive attitude towards smoking (OR = 8.2 (6.5

              Manica and Sofala Provinces in central Mozambique. Methods: Seven
              hundred sixty-one pregnant women tested HIV+, immediately
              initiated antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, and were followed to
              track retention at 6 clinics from May 2014 to May 2015. Clinics
              were randomly allocated within a stepped-wedge fashion to
              intervention and control periods. The intervention included (1)
              workflow modifications and (2) active patient tracking. Retention
              was defined as percentage of patients returning for 30-, 60-, and
              90-day medication refills within 25-35 days of previous refills.
              Results: During control periods, 52.3\% of women returned for
              30-day refills vs. 70.8\% in intervention periods [odds ratio
              (OR): 1.80; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.05 to 3.08]. At 60
              days, 46.1\% control vs. 57.9\% intervention were retained (OR:
              1.82; CI: 1.06 to 3.11), and at 90 days, 38.3\% control vs.
              41.0\% intervention (OR: 1.04; CI: 0.60 to 1.82). In prespecified
              subanalyses, birth before pickups was strongly associated with
              failure - women giving birth before ARV pickup were 33.3 times
              (CI: 4.4 to 250.3), 7.5 times (CI: 3.6 to 15.9), and 3.7 times
              (CI: 2.2 to 6.0) as likely to not return for ARV pickups at 30,
              60, and 90 days, respectively. Conclusions: The intervention was
              effective at 30 and 60 days, but not at 90 days. Combined 90-day
              retention (40\%) and adherence (22.5\%) were low. Efforts to

              genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Proponents argue that GMO
              food sources represent the only viable solution to food shortages
              in an ever-growing global population. Science reports no harm
              from GMO use and consumption so far. Opponents fear the
              potentially negative impact that GMO development and use could
              have on the environment and consumers, and are concerned about
              the lack of data on the long-term effects of GMO use. We discuss
              the development of GMO food sources, the history of legislation
              and policy for the labeling requirements of GMO food products,
              and the health, environmental, and legal rationale for and
              against GMO food labeling. The Food and Drug Administration
              regulates food with GMOs within a coordinated framework of
              federal agencies. Despite mounting scientific evidence that GMO
              foods are substantially equivalent to traditionally bred food
              sources, debate remains over the appropriateness of GMO food
              labeling. In fact, food manufacturers have mounted a First
              Amendment challenge against Vermont's passage of a law that
              requires GMO labeling. Mandatory GMO labeling is not supported by
              science. Compulsory GMO labels may not only hinder the

              analyses, metabolomic analyses seem pertinent to reveal expected
              as well as unexpected compositional differences between plant
              genetically modified organisms (GMO) and non-GMO samples. Data
              previously published in the existing literature led to divergent
              conclusions on the effect of maize transgenes on grain
              compositional changes and feeding effects. Therefore, a new study
              examining field-grown harvested products and feeds derived from
              them remains useful. Objectives: Our aim was to use a
              metabolomics approach to characterize grain and grain-based diet
              compositional changes for two GMO events, one involving Bacillus
              thuringiensis toxin to provide insect resistance and the other
              one conferring herbicide tolerance by detoxification of
              glyphosate. We also investigated the potential compositional
              modifications induced by the use of a glyphosate-based herbicide
              on the transgenic line conferring glyphosate tolerance. Results:
              The majority of statistically significant differences in grain
              composition, evidenced by the use of 1H-NMR profiling of polar
              extracts and LC-ESI-QTOF-MS profiling of semi-polar extracts,
              could be attributed to the combined effect of genotype and
              environment. In comparison, transgene and glyphosate effects
              remained limited in grain for the compound families studied. Some
              but not all compositional changes observed in grain were also
              detected in grain-based diets formulated for rats. Conclusion:
              Only part of the data previously published in the existing
              literature on maize grains of plants with the same GMO events
              could be reproduced in our experiment. All spectra have been
              deposited in a repository freely accessible to the public. Our
              grain and diet characterization opened the way for an in depth

              is associated with children's access to insurance and healthcare
              and with children's physical health. Methods: I use the first
              wave of the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey, which is
              representative of Los Angeles County in 2000--2001, to analyze
              data on parents' and children's immigration status, children's
              health insurance coverage, children's healthcare utilization, and
              children's health, using logistic and ordered logistic regression
              models. Results: I find that undocumented immigrant children face
              severely constrained access to health insurance and a usual
              source of healthcare, while children with foreign-born parents
              have lower global health status than children with U.S.-born

              to a doctor diagnosis for common childhood ailments. Conclusion:
              These results show that without being eligible for public

              implementation of an evidence-based family home visiting (EB-FHV)
              guideline encoded using the Omaha System. Design and sample This
              quality improvement evaluation was conducted using a secondary
              dataset of 27,910 PHN family home visiting interventions from
              visits to 129 adult clients enrolled in EB-FHV programs in a
              Midwestern PHN agency. The interventions were documented 12
              months before and 14 months after EB-FHV Guideline
              implementation. The EB-FHV consisted of 94 PHN interventions for
              10 Omaha System problems, with electronic health record (EHR)
              data generated by PHNs during routine clinical documentation.
              Standard descriptive and inferential statistics were employed in
              the analysis. Measures The Omaha System was used to compare PHN
              practice before and after the guideline implementation. Results
              Documentation patterns revealed that PHNs tailored interventions
              while also shifting toward the use of the EB-FHV guideline
              interventions. Ten EB-FHV problems accounted for 96.3\% of
              interventions documented before and 98.5\% of interventions
              documented after implementation. The proportion of interventions
              before and after EB-FHV by problem differed significantly for all
              problems except Substance use. Fewer interventions were provided
              after EB-FHV for the primary problems of Pregnancy and
              Postpartum, with a shift to more interventions for
              Caretaking/parenting. Conclusion The PHN documentation after
              guideline implementation demonstrated adherence to the EB-FHV
              guideline, while tailoring the evidence-based interventions
              differentially by problem. Further research is needed to extend

              findings from an ecological study of Afghanistan's immunization
              system and a literature review on immunization program delivery,
              the routine immunization system was mapped using causal loop
              diagrams. Next, a stock-and-flow diagram was developed and
              translated to a system dynamics (SD) model for a
              system-confirmatory exercise. Data are from annual health
              facility assessments and two cross-sectional household surveys.
              SD model results were compared with measured readiness and
              service outcomes to confirm system structure. Findings -
              Readiness and demand-side components were associated with
              improved immunization coverage. The routine immunization system
              was mapped using four interlinking readiness subsystems. In the
              SD model, health worker capacity and demand-side factors
              significantly affected maternal health service coverage. System
              readiness components affected their future measures mostly
              negatively, which may indicate that the reinforcing feedback
              drives current system-structured behavior. Originality/value -
              The models developed herein are useful to explore the potential
              impact of candidate interventions on service outcomes. This paper
              documents the process through which public health and systems
              investigators can collaboratively develop models that represent
              the feedback-driven behavior of health systems. Such models allow
              for more realistically addressing health policy and systems-level
              research questions. \copyright{} Emerald Publishing Limited.",

  author   = "Hammoudi, B M and Ismaile, S and Abu Yahya, O",
  abstract = "Background: Patient safety is a significant challenge facing
              healthcare systems. The administration of medication is pivotal
              to patient safety, and errors in drug administration are
              associated with mortality and morbidity. In this study, we
              assessed the factors contributing to the occurrence and reporting
              of medication errors from the nurse's perspective. Methods: In
              this descriptive cross-sectional study, we distributed a
              validated questionnaire to 367 nurses at a large public hospital
              and obtained a response rate of 73.4\%. The questionnaire
              comprised 65 questions, including 29 on the causes of medication
              errors, 16 on the reasons why medication errors are not reported
              and 20 that estimated the percentages of the different medication
              errors actually reported. Informed consent was obtained from all
              participants, and the anonymity and confidentiality of
              participants' information were preserved throughout the process.
              This study received institutional review board approval.
              Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. Results: The
              main factors associated with medication errors by nurses were
              related to medication packaging, nurse-physician communication,
              pharmacy processes, nurse staffing and transcribing issues. The
              main barriers to the reporting of errors by nurses were related
              to the administrative response, fear of reporting and
              disagreements regarding the definitions of errors. Conclusion:
              Medication errors by nurses are related to medication packaging,
              poor communication, unclear medication orders, workload and staff
              rotation. To prevent medication errors, teamwork must be
              improved. All healthcare settings should emphasise awareness of
              the culture of safety, provide support and guidance to nurses and
              improve communication skills. We also recommend the use of
              integrated health informatics, including computerised drug
              administration systems. The limitations of this study include the
              potential for nonresponse bias associated with the sampling
              method. Further research is required to explore the complex and
              multidimensional causes of medication errors and review the
              responses of nurses regarding the errors reported. \copyright{}

              electronic health record system for use in selected public
              hospitals across the country. Since its implementation 15 years
              ago, there has been the critical requirement for a systematic
              evaluation to assess its effectiveness in coping with the current
              system, task complexity, and rapid technological changes. The
              study aims to assess system quality factors to predict the
              performance of electronic health in a single public hospital in
              Malaysia. Methods Non-probability sampling was employed for data
              collection among selected providers in a single hospital for two
              months. Data cleaning and bias checking were performed before
              final analysis in partial least squares-structural equation

              validity assessments were satisfied the required criterions in
              the reflective measurement model. The structural model output
              revealed that the proposed adequate infrastructure, system
              interoperability, security control, and system compatibility were
              the significant predictors, where system compatibility became the

              (SD = 6.1); 21.4\% were married, and 39.1\% were White. Methods
              An evaluation dataset was constructed that included all women of
              childbearing age, their demographics, and outcome assessments. A
              summative SBDH Index based on Institute of Medicine-recommended

              indicated that Iodine Deficiency was not of public health concern
              among children in Zambia at the time of this study. However, the
              proportion of households with access to adequately iodised salt
              (15-40 ppm iodine) was 53\%, which is below the recommended
              target of 90\% or more household coverage. Results from
              questionnaires indicated that the challenges faced by the Zambian
              Government in attaining Universal Salt Iodisation (USI) include:
              (i) lack of sustainability of local salt iodisation in local salt
              producing areas, (ii) weak enforcement of the law on salt
              iodisation, (iii) poor packaging and storage of salt by traders
              and households, (iv) limited knowledge of the link between lack
              of iodine in salt and iodine deficiency, and (v) relatively high
              cost of imported iodised salt in local salt producing areas.",

              the advent of sampling technologies that can generate multiple,

              ocean health assessments and ecosystem management, identifying
              and implementing robust, and efficient processing approaches is a
              challenge for marine scientists. Using a large plankton imagery
              data set, we present two crowd-sourcing approaches applied to the
              problem of classifying millions of organisms. The first used
              traditional crowd-sourcing by asking the public to identify
              plankton through a web-interface. The second challenged the data
              science community to develop algorithms via an industry
              partnership. We found traditional crowd-sourcing was an excellent
              way to engage and educate the public while crowd-sourcing data
              scientists rapidly generated multiple, effective solutions. As
              the need to process and visualize large and complex marine data

              various environmental factors. The internal and external work
              environment factors can exert considerable effects on
              organizational commitment. Among the work environment internal
              factors, which is recently very common, is job burnout or
              exhaustion. According to the fact that the cultural differences
              can be effective on the staff performance, commitment and quality
              of their work, justifying this hypothesis can help managers to
              enhance the staff organizational commitment through improving job
              exhaustion conditions. Therefore, the present study aims at the
              survey of the relationship between job burnout and organizational
              commitment in Zahedan medical sciences university staff.
              Implementation method: the present study is a
              descriptive-analytical research of the cross-sectional type which
              has been conducted on 165 individuals of Zahedan medical sciences
              employees all of whom have been selected randomly in 2016. To
              gather the information required for the analysis, a three-part
              questionnaire was applied, the first part of which was related to
              the demographic characteristics, the second part pertained to
              Maslech burnout inventory (MBI) and the third part included Allen
              and Mayer's standard questionnaire. In the end, the data were
              analyzed by making use of SPSS 19 software and the descriptive
              statistics, Pierson correlation, variance analysis and
              independent t-test were analyzed. Findings: the results of the
              present study indicated that the individuals' average age was
              36.32 $\pm$ 9.96. And 103 individuals were women and 139 were
              married. The overall mean score obtained from the organizational
              commitment questionnaire was 73.45 $\pm$ 4.54 and the overall
              mean score of the job burnout inventory score was 58.58 $\pm$
              10.15. There was not found a significant relationship between the
              gender and marital status with job burnout and organizational
              commitment (P>0.05). The relationship between job exhaustion and
              organizational commitment was not statistically significant
              (P=0.235). Conclusion: according to the results obtained in the
              present study which are indicative of the lack of statistically
              significant relationship between job burnout and organizational
              commitment, it seems that other factors are playing parts in
              organizational commitment and job burnout which are not taken
              into consideration in the present study. \copyright{} 2016,

              antiretroviral treatment. Our review aims, firstly, to determine
              whether HIV self-testing is an effective method to increase the
              uptake of testing, the yield of new HIV-positive diagnoses, and
              the linkage to antiretroviral treatment. Secondly, we aim to

              self-testing. Methods/design: Participants will be adults living
              in Africa. For the first aim, the intervention will be HIV
              self-testing either alone or in addition to HIV testing standard
              of care. The comparison will be HIV testing standard of care. The
              primary outcomes will be (i) uptake of HIV testing and (ii) yield
              of new HIV-positive diagnoses. The secondary outcomes will be (a)
              linkage to antiretroviral (ARV) treatment and (b) incidence of
              social harms. For the second aim, we will review barriers and
              facilitators to the uptake of self-testing. We will search
              PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus,
              Web of Science, WHOLIS, Africa Wide, and CINAHL for eligible
              studies from 1998, with no language limits. We will check
              reference lists of included studies for other eligible reports.
              Eligible studies will include experimental and observational
              studies. Two authors will independently screen the search output,
              select studies, and extract data, resolving discrepancies by
              consensus and discussion. Two authors will use Cochrane risk of
              bias tools for experimental studies, the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality
              Assessment Scale for observational studies, and the Critical
              Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) quality assessment tool for

              community-based HIV testing strategies, such as self-testing,
              will contribute to universal coverage of HIV testing in Africa.

              it is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Symptoms of

              symptoms and associated risk factors among the elderly. Materials
              and Methods: A community-based, cross-sectional study was
              conducted among 440 individuals belonging to the elderly
              population from November 2013 to October 2014. A five-item
              version of the Geriatric Depression Scale was used to rate the
              depressive symptoms among the elderly besides asking
              socio-demographic details. Data were collected, coded and entered
              into Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, and it was analyzed using the
              Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 16 software
              (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, United States). Univariate analysis was
              performed using chi-square test and odds ratio. Binary logistic

              from 220 male and female food handlers of different jobs, aged
              between 17--65 years. The samples were cultured on
              bacteriological culture media and bacterial species were
              identified following standard procedures. A structured
              questionnaire was used to record sociodemographic and behavioral
              data analysis of the food handlers. Of the total 220 subjects
              examined, 62.2\% showed positive culture for different bacterial
              species from their fingernail contents, 65.4\% were found to be
              harboring Staphylococcus aureus in their nostrils and 0.9\%
              tested positive for Shigella boydii from stool samples.
              Staphylococcus aureus was the predominant bacteria isolated from
              fingernail specimens (46\%), followed by Escherichia coli
              (29.2\%), Coliforms (18.2\%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.6\%).
              This study showed a statistically significant difference in the
              rate of bacterial infestation between different occupational
              categories (p = 0.04). Butchers showed the highest prevalence of
              bacteria (86.6\%) in their fingernail contents, followed by fast
              food workers (76.5\%), bakers (73.5\%), chicken store workers
              (73\%), school cafeterias staff (53.3\%), restaurant workers

              health. Methods In this systematic mixed-studies review, we
              searched the Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and ProQuest
              databases, and hand searched relevant websites, for articles
              published between Jan 1, 1990, and Aug 31, 2015. We used keywords
              and Medical Subject Headings related to ERW, landmines, UXO, and
              AXO to locate original peer-reviewed quantitative, qualitative,
              or mixed-methods studies in English of the direct physical or
              psychological effects of ERW on direct victims of the explosive
              device or reverberating social and economic effects on direct
              victims and indirect victims (their families and the wider
              at-risk community). We excluded studies if more than 20\% of
              participants were military, if they were of deminers, if they
              were from high-income countries, or if they were of chemical
              weapons. We identified no peer-reviewed studies of AXO effects,
              so we extended the search to include grey literature. We
              critically appraised study quality using a mixed methods
              appraisal tool. We used a narrative synthesis approach to
              categorise and synthesise the literature. We extracted
              quantitative data and calculated means and percentages. Findings
              The initial search identified 10 226 studies, leaving 8378 (82\%)
              after removal of duplicates, of which we reviewed 54 (26 [48\%]
              were quantitative descriptive studies, 20 [37\%] were
              quantitative non-randomised studies, four [7\%] were
              mixed-methods studies, and four [7\%] were grey literature). The
              direct psychological effects of landmines or UXO appear high. We
              identified comorbidity of anxiety and depression in landmine or
              UXO victims in four studies, more women presented with
              post-traumatic stress disorder than did men in two studies, and

              post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, or depression than did
              control groups in two studies. Overall injury and mortality rates
              caused by landmines or UXO decreased over time across five
              studies and increased in one. More men were injured or killed by
              landmines or UXO than were women (0--30·6\% of women), the mean
              ages of casualties ranged from 18·5 years to 38·1 years, and
              victims were likely to be doing an activity of economic necessity
              at the time of injury. The proportion of casualties of landmines
              or UXO younger than 18 years ranged from 22\% to 55\% across
              twelve studies. Landmine or UXO victims who had one or more limbs

              proportion of casualties caused by AXO from unplanned explosions
              at munitions sites, although the grey literature suggests that
              AXO is a substantial problem. Interpretation Individually, these
              landmine and UXO results are not new and substantiate findings
              from existing research. Taken together, however, these findings
              provide a picture of the effect of landmines and UXO that
              stretches far beyond injury and mortality prevalence, making
              landmine and UXO clearance a more favourable option for funders.
              AXO effects are understudied and warrant further research.

              ligands in environmental samples and has been broadly applied in
              studies of endocrine disruption. Estrogenic ligands include both
              natural and manmade ``Environmental Estrogens'' (EEs) found in
              many consumer goods including Personal Care Products (PCPs),
              plastics, pesticides, and foods. EEs disrupt hormone signaling in
              humans and other animals, potentially reducing fertility and
              increasing disease risk. Despite the importance of EEs and other
              Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) to public health, endocrine
              disruption is not typically included in undergraduate curricula.
              This shortcoming is partly due to a lack of relevant laboratory
              activities that illustrate the principles involved while also
              being accessible to undergraduate students. This article presents
              an optimized YES for quantifying ligands in personal care
              products that bind estrogen receptors alpha (ER$\alpha$) and/or
              beta (ER$\beta$). The method incorporates one of the two
              colorimetric substrates
              (ortho-nitrophenyl-$\beta$-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) or
              chlorophenol red-$\beta$-D-galactopyranoside (CPRG)) that are
              cleaved by $\beta$-galactosidase, a 6-day refrigerated incubation
              step to facilitate use in undergraduate laboratory courses, an
              automated application for LacZ calculations, and R code for the
              associated 4-parameter logistic regression analysis. The protocol
              has been designed to allow undergraduate students to develop and
              conduct experiments in which they screen products of their
              choosing for estrogen mimics. In the process, they learn about
              endocrine disruption, cell culture, receptor binding, enzyme
              activity, genetic engineering, statistics, and experimental
              design. Simultaneously, they also practice fundamental and
              broadly applicable laboratory skills, such as: calculating
              concentrations; making solutions; demonstrating sterile
              technique; serially diluting standards; constructing and
              interpolating standard curves; identifying variables and
              controls; collecting, organizing, and analyzing data;
              constructing and interpreting graphs; and using common laboratory
              equipment such as micropipettors and spectrophotometers. Thus,
              implementing this assay encourages students to engage in
              inquiry-based learning while exploring emerging issues in
              environmental science and health. \copyright{} 2017 Journal of

              investigators, reviewers, and editors to submit or accept
              manuscripts for publication based on the direction or the
              strength of the study findings.''Publication bias distorts the
              accumulated data in the literature, causes the over estimation of
              potential benefits of intervention and mantles the risks and
              adverse effects, and creates a barrier to assessing the clinical
              utility of drugs as well as evaluating the long-term safety of
              medical interventions. The World Medical Association, the
              International Committee of Medical Journals, and the Committee on
              Publication Ethics have conferred responsibilities and ethical
              obligations to editors concerning the avoidance of publication
              bias. Despite the explicit statements in these international
              documents, the editors' role in and ability to avoid publication
              bias is still being discussed. Unquestionably, all parties
              involved in clinical research have the ultimate responsibility to
              sustain the research integrity and validity of accumulated
              general knowledge. Cooperation and commitment is required at
              every step of a clinical trial. However, this holistic approach
              does not exclude effective measures to be taken at the editors'
              level. The editors of major medical journals concluded that one
              precaution that editors can take is to mandate registration of
              all clinical trials in a public repository as a precondition to
              submitting manuscripts to journals. Raising awareness regarding
              the value of publishing negative data for the scientific
              community and human health, and increasing the number of journals
              that are dedicated to publishing negative results or that set
              aside a section in their pages to do so, are positive steps
              editors can take to avoid publication bias. \copyright{} 2017,

              prevalence, impact, and interaction of short interpregnancy
              interval (IPI), pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) category, and
              pregnancy weight gain (PWG) on the rate of preterm birth. Methods
              This is a population-based retrospective cohort study using vital
              statistics birth records from 2006 to 2011 in OH, US, analyzing
              singleton live births to multiparous mothers with recorded IPI (n
              = 393,441). Preterm birth rate at <37 weeks gestational age was
              compared between the referent pregnancy (defined as normal
              pre-pregnancy maternal BMI, IPI of 12--24 months, and Institute
              of Medicine (IOM) recommended PWG) and those with short or long
              IPI, abnormal BMI (underweight, overweight, and obese), and high
              or low PWG (under or exceeding IOM recommendations). Results Only
              6 \% of the women in this study had a referent pregnancy, with a
              preterm birth rate of 7.6 \% for this group. Short IPIs of <6 and
              6--12 months were associated with increased rates of preterm
              birth rate to 12.9 and 10.4 \%, respectively. Low PWG compared to
              IOM recommendations for pre-pregnancy BMI class was also
              associated with increased preterm birth rate of 13.2 \% for all
              BMI classes combined. However, the highest rate of preterm birth
              of 25.2 \% occurred in underweight women with short IPI and
              inadequate weight gain with adjOR 3.44 (95 \% CI 2.80, 4.23). The
              fraction of preterm births observed in this cohort that can be
              attributed to short IPIs is 5.9 \%, long IPIs is 8.3 \%,
              inadequate PWG is 7.5 \%, and low pre-pregnancy BMI is 2.2 \%.
              Conclusions Our analysis indicates that a significant proportion
              of preterm births in Ohio are associated with potentially
              modifiable risk factors. These data suggest public health
              initiatives focused on preterm birth prevention could include
              counseling and interventions to optimize preconception health and

  abstract = "In recent years, increasing recognition of the challenges

              countries have revived researcher's interest towards analyzing
              transportation related expenditure of households. The current
              research contributes to travel behaviour literature by developing
              an econometric model of household budgetary allocations with a
              particular focus on transportation expenditure. Towards this end,
              we employ the public-use micro-data extracted from the Survey of
              Household Spending (SHS) for the years 1997--2009. The proposed
              econometric modeling approach is built on the multiple discrete
              continuous extreme value model (MDCEV) framework. Specifically,
              in our analysis, the scaled version of the MDCEV model
              outperformed its other counterparts. Broadly, the model results
              indicated that a host of household socio-economic and demographic
              attributes along with the residential location characteristics
              affect the apportioning of income to various expenditure

              This was a descriptive correlational. The population included 200
              pregnant women of the urban and rural health centers affiliated
              with Babol University of Medical Sciences. There were hundred

              (U.S.) suffer from depression, which has far-reaching
              consequences on maternal and fetal well-being. There is
              conflicting evidence regarding the prevalence of antenatal
              depression among different race and ethnic groups. This
              systematic review aimed to summarize the existing literature
              concerning racial/ethnic disparities in the prevalence and
              correlates of antenatal depression in the U.S. Methods PubMed,
              CINAHL and PsycINFO databases were searched online for research
              studies published in English in peer-reviewed journals until
              March 2015, using a pre-designed search strategy. Eligibility was
              determined using pre-specified criteria; and quality was
              assessed. Results Forty-one (41) articles met the criteria; 13
              were cross-sectional, and 21 were longitudinal studies. Overall,
              the prevalence of antenatal depression was 10--30 \%; it was
              higher among non-Hispanic blacks (NHBs) and Hispanics, compared
              to non-Hispanic whites (NHWs). Few studies looked at the
              correlates of depression by race/ethnicity. Among employed women,
              higher depression scores were observed among NHBs, compared to
              NHWs; while there was no racial difference among unemployed
              women. Racial difference and race-employment interaction
              disappeared once discrimination was accounted for. In another
              study, higher parity, higher stress, and lower self-esteem were
              significant correlates of depression among NHBs, while less
              satisfaction with social support, and higher stress predicted
              higher depression scores among NHWs and Hispanics respectively.
              Conclusions The findings of our review suggest that not only is
              antenatal depression a major public health issue that needs to be
              addressed, but different racial/ethnic groups seem to differ in
              their vulnerability and risk factors. \copyright{} 2016, Springer

  abstract = "Background: Sexuality is an aspect of quality of life that is
              important for many patients and their partners, but may be
              adversely affected by a cardiac event. Therefore, it is necessary
              that cardiologists assess sexual issues among cardiovascular
              patients. However, most health professionals avoid talking about
              sex issues due to some barriers. The recognition of these
              barriers leads to new information that is helpful for future
              planning and intervention in Iran. Objectives: The aim of the
              present study was to identify the barriers to discussing sexual
              issues among cardiovascular patients and to discover
              cardiologists' reasons for not addressing sexual issues. Methods:
              Using a self-made questionnaire, a cross-sectional descriptive
              study was carried out at the seventeenth national congress on
              cardiovascular update which was held in 2015, and cardiologists'
              answers were gathered and analyzed. Results: The study population
              consisted of 138 cardiologists (87 male and 51 female) with a
              mean age of 45.42 years. Analysis of data showed that most of the
              barriers for discussing sexual issues were ``Patient discomfort
              for discussing about sexual issues,'' ``Religious and cultural
              reasons'', ``Not having enough time,'' ``Presence of other
              person'' and ``Lack of knowledge and skill in dealing with sexual
              issues.'' Among the demographic characteristics, cardiologists'
              gender showed a significant relationship with ``Cardiologist
              discomfort for discussing sexual issues'' (P value = 0.005).
              Female cardiologists had more discomfort than male cardiologists.
              Conclusions: From the opinion of cardiologists, patients'
              uncomfortable feelings, cultural-religious issues and time
              restrictions were the most important when discussing sexual
              issues with cardiovascular patients, so these barriers need more
              attention in the delivery of public health interventions.

              assess the heatwave definitions used in the literature published
              up to 1st April 2015 by searching five databases (PubMed,
              ProQuest, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science).
              Random-effects models were used to pool the effects of heatwave
              on total and cardiorespiratory mortality by different heatwave
              definitions. Existing evidence suggests a significant impact of
              heatwave on mortality, but the magnitude of the effect estimates
              varies under different heatwave definitions. Heatwave-related
              mortality risks increased by 4\% (using ``mean temperatures
              $\geq$ 95th percentile for $\geq$ 2 days'' as a heatwave

              relatively more important role than duration in determining
              heatwave-related deaths. Heatwaves significantly increase
              mortality across the globe, but the effect estimates vary with

              total of 637 elderly were included in this analytical
              observational study using a random and multistage cluster
              sampling method. Quality of life and depression scores were

              of its dimensions had a direct relationship with lower age, being

              time information about patients' health state to the doctors and

              clouds via wireless and public communication channels. Therefore,
              a cloud-assisted WBAN facilitates response in case of emergency
              which can save patients' lives. Since the patient's data is

              secure cloud-assisted architecture for accessing and monitoring

              lifetime. While interventions to prevent violence (primary
              prevention) are extremely important, they can take many years.
              This review focuses on secondary and tertiary prevention
              interventions that address the needs of survivors of violence and
              aim to prevent recurrence. This review also focuses on studies
              taking place in low and low-middle income countries, where rates
              of VAW are highest. Methods: Searches of peer-reviewed and grey
              literature took place from March-June 2016 through databases
              (Embase, CINAHL, WHO Global Index Medicus, Medline, PsychINFO,
              Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Applied Social Sciences Index
              and Abstracts and Sociological Abstracts) and by consulting
              experts in the field. Only primary research was eligible for
              inclusion and studies had to focus on secondary or tertiary
              prevention for survivors of VAW in low or low-middle income
              countries. All study designs were eligible, as long as the study
              examined client-related outcome measures (e.g., incidence of
              violence, health outcomes or client satisfaction). Data were
              extracted and quality of the studies was assessed using the
              Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool
              for Quantitative Studies and a qualitative quality assessment
              tool developed by Mays and Pope. Due to the low number of results
              and heterogeneity of the study populations and outcomes, a
              narrative synthesis was conducted and evidence was summarized.
              Results: One thousand two hundred fifteen studies were identified
              through the search strategy and 22 of these met the eligibility
              criteria. Overall, the evidence for interventions is weak and
              study limitations prevent definitive conclusions on what works.
              There is some evidence that interventions targeting alcohol use,
              both among perpetrators and survivors, may be effective at
              reducing VAW through secondary prevention, and that psychotherapy
              might be effective for survivors of non-partner sexual violence
              through tertiary prevention. Finally, some evidence exists for
              crisis centres increasing survivors' access to services (through
              both secondary and tertiary prevention), however, assessment of
              their impact on future VAW are needed. Conclusions: Though some
              interventions for survivors of VAW have shown evidence of
              effectiveness, further research is needed, especially
              high-quality studies with quantitative outcome data. \copyright{}

              chemicals, including many compounds with known or suspected
              health effects. However, most dust exposure studies measure few
              chemicals in small samples. We systematically searched the U.S.
              indoor dust literature on phthalates, replacement flame
              retardants (RFRs), perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), synthetic

              geometric means (GMs) and 95\% confidence intervals for 45
              chemicals measured in $\geq$3 data sets. In order to rank and
              contextualize these results, we used the pooled GMs to calculate
              residential intake from dust ingestion, inhalation, and dermal
              uptake from air, and then identified hazard traits from the Safer
              Consumer Products Candidate Chemical List. Our results indicate
              that U.S. indoor dust consistently contains chemicals from
              multiple classes. Phthalates occurred in the highest
              concentrations, followed by phenols, RFRs, fragrance, and PFASs.
              Several phthalates and RFRs had the highest residential intakes.

  abstract = "Background and Aim: Biological incidents are one of the most
              important threats to the people's health which can disturb the
              national security bases and cause public fear in any country. The
              preparedness of hospitals to deal with such events can play a
              major role in reducing casualties, maintaining the authority of
              countries, and increasing the public trust in governments. Given
              the importance of this issue, and since few similar studies have
              been conducted in Iran, the present study aimed to assess the
              biological incidents preparedness of hospitals in Markazi
              province during 2016. Methods: The present research was a
              cross-sectional study. The statistical population included all
              the hospitals of Markazi province, including 14 hospitals of the
              Arak University of Medical Sciences, 2 private hospitals, and 3
              social security hospitals. The data collection tool was the
              American Hospital Association Chemical and Bioterrorism
              Preparedness Checklist that contained 120 questions, which was
              used after translation into Farsi and localization. The data were
              collected through interviewing with hospital managers and
              reviewing documents from May to February 2016. At the end they
              were statistically analyzed in SPSS-16. Results: The mean score
              of general information, communication, meeting the needs of
              patients, organizing, support and logistics, process of medical
              treatments, education, hospital management and security,

              for dealing with biological incidents was obtained 26, which is
              considered poor. Conclusion: With regard to the complexity and
              novelty of issues on management and preparedness for biological
              incidents, the level of preparedness of hospitals in the Markazi
              province in this study was evaluated poor, as expected. It
              requires paying special attention to this issue by the
              authorities and adopting quick and serious strategies and
              solutions to increase the preparedness of hospitals. Hence, it is
              highly necessary to evaluate the preparedness of medical centers
              across Iran in biological incidents and to develop some programs
              for dealing with them.",

              Africa (SSA) where many people with the condition receive no
              treatment. Health-care services for epilepsy in this region have
              not been comprehensively assessed. We examined key features of
              epilepsy health services provided in SSA. Methodology This was a
              scoping review conducted using pre-specified protocols. We
              implemented an electronic search strategy to identify relevant
              citations using PUBMED, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus,
              Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature
              (CINAHL), African Index Medicus (AIM), Open Grey, Cochrane
              database, and Google Scholar. Articles eligible for full-text
              review were screened and data of interest were reported. Result
              The search identified 81 eligible articles, forty-nine from East
              Africa, 19 from West Africa, 8 from South Africa, and 5 from
              Central Africa. A variety of care services were identified, with
              reporting of rural epilepsy care in 75\% of retrieved articles
              mainly from East and South African countries. The majority of the
              rural epilepsy clinics were health worker- or nurse-led,
              reporting good seizure control in about two-thirds of patients
              using phenobarbital as the most commonly prescribed antiepileptic
              drug. Funding for rural epilepsy care came mainly from external
              donor agencies. Conclusion We attempted to provide a `snapshot'
              of epilepsy care services in SSA. The successes achieved in some
              of the centers are due to the use of existing primary health-care
              systems and employing non-physician health-care personnel. The
              true picture of epilepsy care coverage is not apparent due to the
              lack of data and proper health system structure in most parts of
              SSA. As more individuals begin to receive care, the long-term
              funding for epilepsy care in African countries will depend on the
              commitment of their respective governments. \copyright{} 2017

              and addressing the social contexts and behavioral factors that

              attributable risk percent (PAR\%) is to estimate the disease
              burden in a population exposed to several risk factors.
              Therefore, this study was conducted to estimates the PAR\% of the
              space-time clusters of pulmonary tuberculosis. Methods: In this
              study, the data of pulmonary TB cases were obtained from the
              health department of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences.
              After detecting significant clusters using the spatiotemporal
              scan statistic, PAR\% was used to analyze the clusters and to
              detect the location of clusters more accurately. Results: Four
              primary space-time clusters and three secondary spatiotemporal
              clusters were detected for patients with pulmonary tuberculosis
              and 92\% of the patients who did not have a clear state in term
              of HIV infection. Despite differences in the location of clusters

              0.76) and area-level SEP ($\alpha$ = 0.88) were divided into
              tertiles. Data analysis was done using t-tests and ANOVA.
              Significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: The prevalence of oral
              pain among the adult South Africans was 19.4 \% (95 \% CI =
              17.2-21.9). The most commonly reported form of oral pain was
              'toothache' (78.9 \%). The majority of the wealthiest
              participants sought care from private dental clinics (64.7 \%),
              or from public dental clinics (19.7 \%), while the poorest tended
              to visit a public dental clinic (45 \%) or nurse/general medical
              practitioner (17.4 \%). In the poorest areas, 21 \% responded to
              pain by 'doing nothing'. The individual expenditure for oral pain
              showed a social gradient from an average of ZAR61.44 spent by
              those of lowest SEP to ZAR433.83 by the wealthiest (national
              average ZAR170.92). Average time lost from school/work was two
              days over the six-month period, but days lost was highest for
              those living in middle class neighbourhoods (3.41), while those
              from the richest neighbourhood had lost significantly fewer days
              from oral pain (0.64). Conclusions: There is a significant social
              gradient in the burden of oral pain. Improved access to dental
              care, possibly through carefully planned universal National
              Health Insurance (NHI), may reduce oral health disparities in
              South Africa. \copyright{} 2016 The Author(s).",

              76 specialist hospitals for the morbidly obese in Brazil's public
              healthcare system (SUS) from 2010 to 2014 in terms of quantity
              and costs of bariatric surgery and its complications. Methods:
              Secondary data from the SUS Hospital Information System and the
              National Healthcare Establishments Registry were used. Current
              spending on bariatric surgery and its medical and postoperative
              complications were analyzed. Results: There was a 60 \% rise in
              the number of surgeries between 2010 and 2014. This increase was
              not homogeneous among the hospitals studied, since only 19
              performed the minimum number of surgeries required. Women
              accounted for 85 \% of the surgeries carried out, and 32 \% were
              aged between 35 and 44 years. The Roux-en-Y technique was the
              most widely used (93.7 \% of the total), followed by sleeve
              gastrectomy. The ratio between the occurrence of medical
              complications and total number of surgeries performed in each
              hospital varied significantly (between 0 and 5.97 \%) but was
              lower for postoperative complications, ranging from 0 to 1.7 \%.
              There was a nominal increase of 44 \% in average expenditure on
              postoperative complications between 2013 and 2014, while the
              average cost of medical complications decreased by 8.7 \% in the

              bariatric surgeries in Brazil, there is still a high demand for
              surgeries that is not being met, while most specialist hospitals
              fail to perform the minimum number of surgeries stipulated by the

              current approaches (e.g. topic modeling, sentiment analysis and

              medical data. Therefore, data collecting entities, such as
              states, seek to disseminate this medical data as widely as
              possible while still maintaining the privacy of the individual
              for legal and ethical reasons. One common way in which this
              medical data is released is through the use of Web-based Data
              Query Systems (WDQS). In this article, we examined WDQS listed in
              the National Association for Public Health Statistics and
              Information Systems (NAPHSIS) specifically reviewing them for how
              they prevent statistical disclosure in queries that produce a
              tabular response. One of the most common methods to combat this
              type of disclosure is through the use of suppression, that is, if
              a cell count in a table is below a certain threshhold, the true
              value is suppressed. This technique does work to prevent the
              direct disclosure of small cell counts, however, primary
              suppression by itself is not always enough to preserve privacy in
              tabular data. Here, we present several real examples of tabular
              response queries that employ suppression, but we are able to
              infer the values of the suppressed cells, including cells with 1
              counts, which could be linked to auxiliary data sources and thus
              has the possibility to create an identity disclosure. We seek to
              stimulate awareness of the potential for disclosure of
              information that individuals may wish to keep private through an
              online query system. This research is undertaken in the hope that
              privacy concerns can be dealt with preemptively rather than only
              after a major disclosure has taken place. In the wake of a such
              an event, a major concern is that state and local officials would
              react to this by permanently shutting down these sites and
              cutting off a valuable source of research data. \copyright{}

              (CHIP) is uncertain after 2017. Survey-based research shows
              positive associations between CHIP expansions and children's
              healthcare utilization. To build on this prior work, we used
              electronic health record (EHR) data to assess temporal patterns
              of healthcare utilization after Oregon's 2009--2010 CHIP
              expansion. We hypothesized increased post-expansion utilization
              among children who gained public insurance. Methods Using EHR
              data from 154 Oregon community health centers, we conducted a
              retrospective cohort study of pediatric patients (2--18 years
              old) who gained public insurance coverage during the Oregon
              expansion (n = 3054), compared to those who were continuously
              publicly insured (n = 10,946) or continuously uninsured (n =
              10,307) during the 2-year study period. We compared pre-post
              rates of primary care visits, well-child visits, and dental
              visits within- and between-groups. We also conducted longitudinal
              analysis of monthly visit rates, comparing the three insurance
              groups. Results After Oregon's 2009--2010 CHIP expansions, newly
              insured patients' utilization rates were more than double their
              pre-expansion rates [adjusted rate ratios (95 \% confidence
              intervals); increases ranged from 2.10 (1.94--2.26) for primary
              care visits to 2.77 (2.56--2.99) for dental visits]. Utilization
              among the newly insured spiked shortly after coverage began, then
              leveled off, but remained higher than the uninsured group.
              Conclusions This study used EHR data to confirm that CHIP
              expansions are associated with increased utilization of essential
              pediatric primary and preventive care. These findings are timely
              to pending policy decisions that could impact children's access
              to public health insurance in the United States. \copyright{}

              sexuality education (SE)-related policy or practical issues using
              review methods to search and critically appraise the existing SE
              approaches targeting children under age 12 yr. Methods: We
              completed the data collection by an extensive search of the
              English and Persian published and unpublished literature,
              evidence from experts in the topic, and by searching citations.
              The MeSH-terms were sexuality and training, sexuality education
              and programs or approaches, sexuality and children, sexuality
              education and parents, sex or sexuality education, sex education
              and parents or caregivers. A systematic search of medical and
              health-related databases, the Cochrane Library and Web of Science
              was undertaken for the years 1970--2015 together with citation
              searching, reference list checking and recommendations from
              stakeholders to identify evidence for SE. Results: According to
              the inclusion criteria, 20 documents were identified. They were
              synthesized into three main categories as sexuality-related
              knowledge, attitudes, and parentsʼ skills to manage children's
              sexual behavior and related education. Employed approaches to
              children's sexuality were reported to be effective in developing
              healthy sexual behavior in children. Education was identified as
              the primary focus of the included packages and guidelines.
              Parents were recognized as first line educators in SE. However,
              interventions aiming to improve parents' skills in SE for
              children were limited. In other words, developing skills in
              parents, and their competency in childrenʼs sexual behavior
              management were not specified in the existing programs.
              Conclusion: Parentsʼ skill-building must be the focus of SE
              programs in order to address children' sexual development goals.

              practices and processes used in the RTW of injured nurses, and
              determine if these are consistent with the seven principles for
              successful RTW as described by the Canadian Institute for Work \&
              Health. Method As part of a larger cross-sectional study, survey
              data were collected from New South Wales nurses who had sustained
              a major workplace injury or illness. Survey questions were coded

              Of the 484 surveys eligible for analysis, most were from
              Registered Nurses (52\%) in the Public Hospital Sector (48\%).
              Responses indicated four main areas of concern: a commitment to
              health and safety by the workplace; early and considerate
              employer contact; provision of modified work; and individual
              knowledge of and involvement in the RTW process. Positive

              or active travel (OR 0.80). The odds of reporting longer sitting
              times was less for those who lived in a local area where more
              people commuted to work by private vehicle (OR 0.65). Those who
              had a longer commute times, regardless of travel mode, had
              greater odds of reporting more sitting during a typical weekday
              (OR 1.67). In turn, those who spent more time sitting had
              significantly greater odds of reporting poorer self-rated health
              (OR 1.34). Such work provides evidence to policy-makers to help
              build the argument for which area-level attributes are needed to
              support urban employment across a region. \copyright{} 2016,

              farms in Jordan. Milk samples were collected from bulk tanks at
              117 dairy farms (44 cattle, 47 sheep, and 26 goat dairy farms) in
              each region of the country. MRSA were isolated on mecA and mecC
              chromogenic media and confirmed by PCR. The confirmed isolates
              were tested for resistance toward 15 antimicrobials by the disc
              diffusion method. None of the tested bulk milk samples were
              positive for mecC and 26\% (95\% CI 20--32\%) were positive for
              mecA MRSA. Specifically, mecA MRSA was detected in 31.8\% (95\%
              CI 17.5--46.1) of cattle, 29.8\% (95\% CI 16.2--43.4) of sheep,
              and 11.5\% (95\% CI − 1.6--24.7\%) of goat dairy farms. All
              isolates (n = 86) exhibited resistance to penicillin, oxacillin,
              cefoxitin; meanwhile, most isolates (70--85\%) exhibited
              resistance toward gentamicin, clindamycin, rifampicin, neomycin,
              fusidic acid, erythromycin, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin. All
              mecA MRSA isolates were resistant to at least one class of
              antimicrobials. Isolates from all goat milk, 88\% of cattle milk,
              and 87\% of sheep milk samples exhibited resistance to three
              classes of antimicrobials and were considered multidrug resistant
              (MDR). These data demonstrate widespread MDR MRSA in dairy
              ruminants in Jordan, and these rates are higher than those
              reported in other countries. Such high prevalence of MDR MRSA and
              mecA MRSA could lead to economic losses in the dairy industry in
              Jordan and poses a possible public health risk. \copyright{}

              are scaling up to meet the data demands of these ambitious
              objectives. Methods: Since 2008, the US Department of Defense
              HIV/AIDS Prevention Program (DHAPP) has been working with
              military partners in 14 countries on implementation and adoption
              of a Military eHealth Information Network (MeHIN). Each country
              implementation plan followed a structured process using
              international eHealth standards. DHAPP worked with the private
              sector to develop a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) electronic
              medical record (EMR) for the collection of data, including
              patient demographic information, clinical notes for general
              medical care, HIV encounters, voluntary medical male
              circumcision, and tuberculosis screening information. Results:
              The COTS software approach provided a zero-dollar software
              license and focused on sharing a single version of the EMR across
              countries, so that all countries could benefit from software
              enhancements and new features over time. DHAPP also worked with
              the public sector to modify open source disease surveillance
              tools and open access of HIV training materials. Important
              lessons highlight challenges to eHealth implementation, including
              a paucity of technology infrastructure, military leadership
              rotations, and the need for basic computer skills building.

              maintained with requisite security, flexibility, and reporting
              capabilities that provide critical information to improve the

              to understand the determinants of gender gaps, evaluate policies
              and monitor countries' progress. With this aim, over the past two
              decades, research has mainly been directed towards the
              development of composite indices. The purpose of this paper is to
              introduce a new and interdisciplinary perspective to the current
              debate on measuring gender inequality in human development. As a
              starting point, we develop a simple macroeconomic model of the
              interdependence between human development and gender inequality.
              We then introduce a biometric indicator, based on the ratio of
              female to male body mass index, to measure women's empowerment at
              the country level. Finally, by using the latest available data,
              we examine the ability of this biometric indicator to capture
              countries' performance in achieving gender equality. We obtain
              five main results: 1) we provide a theoretical framework to
              explain the joint determination of human development and gender
              inequality; 2) we show how to use this framework to simulate the
              impact of exogenous shocks or policy changes; 3) we demonstrate
              that exogenous changes have a direct and a multiplier effect on
              human development and gender inequality; 4) we find that the
              distribution of obesity between the female and male populations
              represents a useful proxy variable for measuring gender equality
              at the country level; 5) finally, we use these results to
              integrate and develop existing knowledge on the `ecological'
              approach to the overweight and obesity pandemic. \copyright{}

              analyzed using linear regression, Pearson's Chi square, and
              t-tests. Over time new SEP registrants have become younger, more
              racially diverse, and geographically more concentrated in
              specific areas of the city, corresponding to urban demographic
              shifts. The number of new registrants per year has decreased,
              however syringes exchanged have increased. Gentrification,
              cultural norms, and changes in risk perception are believed to
              have contributed to the changes in SEP registration. Demographic
              changes indicate outreach strategies for IDUs may need adjusting
              to address unique barriers for younger, more racially diverse
              users. Implications for SEPs are discussed, including policy and
              continued ability to address current public health threats.

              changes in individuals' sense of coherence while living with
              long-term illness as they engage in a broadly applicable health
              promotion intervention developed in specialist care settings that
              was later implemented in the community care context. Method: This
              study had a pre-postdesign. Sense of coherence was measured using
              the SOC-29 questionnaire at baseline and within 14 days of
              programme completion. The total baseline sample included 108
              Norwegian adults (aged 21-89) with chronic illness. Data were
              analysed using paired samples t-tests. Results: In both clinical
              sites, the total sample's mean SOC score changed positively from
              the baseline to the follow-up 4 months later. This change was
              larger for the participants in the community care context.
              Manageability increased significantly for women. Significant
              positive changes in SOC score and the manageability dimension
              were also identified among participants who had children. Similar
              findings were found for those who were living with a partner, as
              well as for public transfer payment recipients. Conclusion: The
              intervention contributed to a positive change in participants'
              SOC while living with illness. The findings revealed that the
              intervention is a flexible health promotion tool across age,
              diagnostic categories and clinical sites. The community
              participants' SOC changed the most, which indicates that the
              intervention is especially relevant in the follow-up of persons
              living with long-term illness within the community. The
              intervention contributes to a shift of perspectives in health

              Sciences Version 20.0. Results In total, 205 valid questionnaires
              were collected. Based on the data collected, 80 (39.0\%) money
              boys had used drugs within the last 3 months. Rush popper
              (36.6\%) and methamphetamine (12.7\%) were used most commonly,
              and other drugs used were ecstasy (7.8\%), ketamine (5.9\%),

              with an emphasis on implementation determinants and outcomes.
              Implementation determinants include inner context factors,
              specifically therapist knowledge and attitudes (N = 114) towards
              evidence-based practices. Implementation outcomes include rate of
              PTSD diagnoses in agencies over time, number of youth receiving
              TF-CBT over time, and penetration (i.e., number of youth
              receiving TF-CBT divided by the number of youth screening
              positive on trauma screening). We describe lessons learned from
              our experiences building a trauma-informed public behavioral

              ``Smoking and its impact on pulp and periodontal health''.
              Methods: a careful review was conducted of scientific papers
              published in the last five years (2012-2016) about topics related
              to the following descriptor combinations: dental pulp ``and''

              the mental health status of population aged 15 and over in the
              province of Ardebil in 2015. Methods: The statistical population
              of this cross-sectional field survey consisted of residents of
              urban and rural areas of Ardebil province in Iran. An estimated
              sample size of 1200 people were chosen using systematic random
              cluster sampling. Access was provided by the contribution of
              Geographical Post Office of Ardebil, Pars abad and Germi cities.
              The General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28) was used as the
              screening tool for mental disorders. Data analysis in the current
              study was carried out using the SPSS-18 software. Results: Using
              GHQ traditional scoring method, the results showed that 21.4\% of
              individuals (26.3\% of females and 16.5\% of males) were
              suspected of mental disorders. The prevalence of suspected cases
              of mental disorders was 20.8\% in urban and 22.8\% in rural
              areas. The results also showed that somatization and anxiety
              symptoms were more prevalent than social dysfunction and
              depression symptoms, and were more common in women than men. The
              results of this research also showed that the prevalence of
              suspected cases of mental disorders increased with aging. Such
              disorders were more common in females, age group of 65 and above,
              people living in rural areas, divorced and widowed, illiterate
              and unemployed individuals compared with other groups.
              Conclusion: The results of this study showed that about one fifth
              of people in the province were suspected of mental disorders.
              Therefore, it is mandatory for the provincial public health
              authorities to take the needed steps to ensure that necessary

              feeding practices in Lusaka, Zambia. Methods A cross-sectional
              face-to-face survey was conducted with 320 married postpartum
              women at a large public health center in Lusaka, Zambia, in 2014.
              Variables were measured using previously validated instruments
              from the Demographic and Health Survey. Data were analyzed using
              simple and multivariate logistic regression in Stata 12. Results
              Thirty-seven percent of women report early mixed infant feeding
              prior to six months. Women who experienced intimate partner
              violence have 2.8 higher adjusted odds of early mixed infant
              feeding (p < 0.001). Women who experienced emotional violence,
              specifically, have 1.9 higher adjusted odds of early mixed infant
              feeding (p < 0.05), while women who experienced sexual violence
              have 2.3 higher adjusted odds (p < 0.01). There is also a
              dose--response relationship between IPV and early mixed infant
              feeding (p < 0.05). Lastly, disclosing one's HIV-positive status
              to the husband is associated with at least 67 \% lower adjusted
              odds of early mixed feeding (p < 0.05). Conclusions Intimate
              partner violence against HIV-positive women, in particular
              emotional and sexual violence, increases the likelihood of early
              mixed infant feeding, putting infants at greater risk for both

              association between SUD and suicide. Our outcomes of interest
              were suicide ideation, suicide attempt and suicide death. For
              each outcome, we calculated the odds ratio (OR) or risk ratio

              epidemiological features of infectious diseases are rarely
              studied. In this study, we aimed to assess specific incidence and
              mortality trends of 45 notifiable infectious diseases from 2004
              to 2013 in China and to investigate the overall effectiveness of
              current prevention and control strategies. Methods Incidence and
              mortality data for 45 notifiable infectious diseases were
              extracted from a WChinese public health science data centre from
              2004 to 2013, which covers 31 provinces in mainland China. We
              estimated the annual percentage change in incidence of each
              infectious disease using joinpoint regression. Findings Between
              January, 2004, and December, 2013, 54 984 661 cases of 45
              infectious diseases were reported (average yearly incidence
              417·98 per 100 000). The infectious diseases with the highest
              yearly incidence were hand, foot, and mouth disease (114·48 per
              100 000), hepatitis B (81·57 per 100 000), and tuberculosis
              (80·33 per 100 000). 132 681 deaths were reported among the 54
              984 661 cases (average yearly mortality 1·01 deaths per 100 000;
              average case fatality 2·4 per 1000). Overall yearly incidence of
              infectious disease was higher among males than females and was
              highest among children younger than 10 years. Overall yearly
              mortality was higher among males than females older than 20 years
              and highest among individuals older than 80 years. Average yearly
              incidence rose from 300·54 per 100 000 in 2004 to 483·63 per 100
              000 in 2013 (annual percentage change 5·9\%); hydatid disease
              (echinococcosis), hepatitis C, and syphilis showed the fastest
              growth. The overall increasing trend changed after 2009, and the
              annual percentage change in incidence of infectious disease in
              2009--13 (2·3\%) was significantly lower than in 2004--08
              (6·2\%). Interpretation Although the overall incidence of
              infectious diseases was increasing from 2004, the rate levelled

              advance understanding of brain structure and function. Key
              developments since 1998 include the huge increase in publicly
              available electronic information; acknowledgement by leaders in
              government and science of the importance of biomedical

  author   = "Shawar, Y R and Shiffman, J",
  abstract = "Despite progress, early childhood development (ECD) remains a
              neglected issue, particularly in resource-poor countries. We
              analyse the challenges and opportunities that ECD proponents face
              in advancing global priority for the issue. We triangulated among
              several data sources, including 19 semi-structured interviews
              with individuals involved in global ECD leadership, practice, and
              advocacy, as well as peer-reviewed research, organisation
              reports, and grey literature. We undertook a thematic analysis of
              the collected data, drawing on social science scholarship on
              collective action and a policy framework that elucidates why some
              global initiatives are more successful in generating political
              priority than others. The analysis indicates that the ECD
              community faces two primary challenges in advancing global
              political priority. The first pertains to framing: generation of
              internal consensus on the definition of the problem and
              solutions, agreement that could facilitate the discovery of a
              public positioning of the issue that could generate political
              support. The second concerns governance: building of effective
              institutions to achieve collective goals. However, there are
              multiple opportunities to advance political priority for ECD,
              including an increasingly favourable political environment,
              advances in ECD metrics, and the existence of compelling

              There is need for robust research to establish factors associated
              with suicidal ideation among in-school adolescents. In Trinidad
              and Tobago, considerable level of research has been conducted on
              suicidal ideation among adolescents. However, more research is
              still needed in order to establish and profile factors associated
              with suicidal ideation among in-school adolescents. The objective
              of this chapter was to determine factors associated with suicidal
              ideation among in-school adolescents in Trinidad and Tobago.
              Analysis of the secondary data from the 2011 Trinidad and Tobago
              Global School-Based Health Survey was conducted using bivariate
              and multivariate logistic regression at 95\% confidence interval.
              The study recruited a total of 2,811 students. The results showed
              that the proportion of students who reported suicidal ideation
              was 16.3\% and female (19.3\%) students reported a higher
              (p<0.001) proportion than males (13.3\%). Having understanding
              parents, history of bullying, being of male gender and being 15
              years of age were negatively associated with suicidal ideation,
              while food security, anxiety, lack of close friends, loneliness,
              history of attack, involvement in a fight, truancy, currently
              smoking, alcohol abuse, current alcohol use and marijuana use
              were all positively associated with suicidal ideation. Therefore,
              issues relating to family and parental support structure, age and
              gender, violence among peers and substance abuse should be
              considered when planning and implementing public health
              intervention programs against suicidal ideation among in-school
              adolescents in Trinidad and Tobago. \copyright{} 2017 Nova

  author   = "Farholm, A and S{\o}rensen, M and Halvari, H",
  abstract = "Background: There has been increasing interest for investigating
              the role of motivation in physical activity among people with
              severe mental illness (SMI). Autonomous motivation has been
              suggested to have a potentially important role in adoption and
              maintenance of physical activity. However, the knowledge about
              factors that facilitate autonomous motivation among people with
              SMI is scarce. Aim: The aim of this study was to examine factors
              associated with motivation for physical activity as well as the
              relationships between motivation, physical activity and
              health-related quality of life in individuals with SMI that were
              currently physically active. Methods: A cross-sectional design
              was used, and 88 participants were recruited from a public health
              network promoting physical activity for people with SMI. They
              answered a questionnaire package consisting of scales measuring
              psychological need support -- psychological need satisfaction --
              and motivation for physical activity, physical activity and
              health-related quality of life. Results: The majority of
              participants reported to be in regular physical activity.
              Associations between variables were tested according to the
              self-determination theory process model. Structural equation
              modelling yielded good fit of the process model to the data.
              Specifically, a need-supportive environment was positively
              associated with psychological need satisfaction, while
              psychological need satisfaction was positively associated with
              autonomous motivation and mental health-related quality of life,
              and negatively associated with controlled motivation and
              amotivation. Physical activity was positively associated with
              autonomous motivation and physical health-related quality of
              life, and negatively associated with amotivation. Conclusion:
              This study indicates that individuals with SMI can be regularly
              physically active when provided with suitable opportunities.
              Furthermore, the present results suggest that it is vital for
              health-care practitioners to emphasise creating a need-supportive
              environment when organising physical activity because such an
              environment is associated with both increased autonomous
              motivation for physical activity and mental health-related
              quality of life. \copyright{} 2016 Nordic College of Caring

              Data, and the data sciences field in general, has been hyped as

              researchers are exposing the potential and harmful effects Big
              Data can have on patient care associating it with increased
              medical costs, patient mortality, and misguided decision making

              and 2013 participated in this study. Pre- and post-surveys

              responsibility for reducing childhood obesity with both closed-
              and open-ended questions. In 2013, quantitative data were

              regression multivariate analysis was used to identify MA

              Patient education was the most commonly examined (20 \%),
              followed by self-management (17 \%). Most studies (61 \%) focused
              on patient-level outcomes (e.g. disease severity), while 31 \%
              included system-level outcomes (e.g. number of eye examinations),

              interventions. A future systematic review can be conducted of the

  abstract = "Background: A substantial part of literature has been centered on
              sex differences in the clinical aspects of ischemic heart disease
              (IHD). Many reports have documented differences in the
              presentation and risk profile between women and men. Such
              differences drive sex-related inequalities in the referral and
              treatment of IHD. Yet data are insufficient to clarify the
              reasons for such disparities. The objective of this review is to
              analyze the main gender differences regarding symptoms,
              diagnosis, and risk stratification of coronary heart disease in
              order to identify ``gaps'' in existing literature that need to be
              addressed in future research efforts. Methods: We searched
              English-language studies on MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of
              Systematic Reviews from the database start dates to January 2016.
              Evidence synthesis was based on cohort studies, registry data,
              and clinical trial data. Results: Women do not often participate
              in clinical studies. In a number of articles, authors have
              questioned how the ``white male'' came to be the prototype of the
              human research subject. Consequently although many reports
              continue to describe differential treatment based on patients'
              sex, the extent to which such inequalities are due to true sex
              differences in pathophysiology or whether they reflects
              inaccuracy in risk stratification is unclear. Conclusion: Today,
              even the best database is incapable in and of itself of supplying
              answers to the question of whether women are being treated less
              compared with men by the medical community. \copyright{} 2016

              high cost of R\&D. This paper investigates whether this statement
              is justified in the case of sofosbuvir, which was commercialized
              at a particularly high price. With sofosbuvir, Gilead Sciences
              Inc. had for several months a monopoly on the interferon-free
              treatment of HCV infected people. Information, usually not
              publicly disclosed, was derived from a report on a US Senate
              enquiry on the price of a course of therapy of sofosbuvir. Other
              sources were the Gilead website and other webpages. Revenue data
              were available in the Senate Report and in the Gilead financial
              report to SEC. R\&D cost was derived again from the Senate
              Report, from the annual reports in the Gilead website and from
              literature. Gilead appeared to be rather efficient in the R\&D
              process, showing cost and failure rate much better than those
              reported in the literature. Revenue was orders of magnitude
              larger than production and R\&D costs. The premium granted to
              Gilead by monopoly is estimated. Pressure from patients on payor
              and the role of the monopoly in generating such a large amount of
              revenue are discussed. An ideal business plan on sofosbuvir
              commercialization is then designed, based on the number of
              patients in the USA and EU, to show the hypothetic burden on

              AIDS representations over the last decades. For the research, we
              decided to consult Italian newspaper articles produced between
              1985 and 1990 and between 2005 and 2010 using the archives of the
              main two national newspapers (La Repubblica and Corriere della

              A computer-aided content analysis allowed the detection of five
              different thematic domains (clusters), respectively focused on:
              Medical care (7.47\%), Family support (37.03\%), Science and

              results. Objective: To examine current study evidence and
              determine the strength and direction of the association between
              SF and puberty timing. Methods: PubMed, OVID, Web of Science,
              EBSCO, and four Chinese databases were searched from their date
              of inception to February 2016. All cohort studies that examined
              the association between SF and puberty timing in children were
              identified. Two reviewers independently screened the studies,
              assessed the quality of included studies, and extracted the data.
              The quality of the included cohort studies was assessed by the
              Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Risk ratio (RR), Weighted Mean Difference
              (WMD), and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and
              pooled by RevMan5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration, London, UK).
              Results: A total of 10 cohort studies involving 2366 subjects was
              included in the final analysis. The pooled estimates showed that
              SF did not significantly increase the number of pubertal children
              in boys (RR: 0.97; 95\% CI: 0.82 to 1.15), or in girls (RR: 0.91;
              95\% CI: 0.79 to 1.04). Compared with the control group, the SF
              group had an earlier onset of puberty in girls (WMD: -0.64; 95\%
              CI: -1.21 to -0.06), and in precocious pubarche (PP) girls (WMD:
              -0.10; 95\% CI: -0.13 to -0.07). There was no difference in the
              onset of puberty in boys (WMD: -0.48; 95\% CI: -1.45 to 0.50)
              between SF and control groups. The pooled result indicated an
              earlier age at menarche in girls born small for gestational age
              (WMD: -0.30; 95\% CI: -0.58 to -0.03), but no difference in the
              age at menarche in the SF group of PP girls. Conclusions: SF may
              be associated with an earlier age of onset of puberty, especially
              among girls, as well as earlier age at menarche for girls.

              types of health risk assessment models categorized by exposure
              pathways. Namely, ingestion, dermal contact, and inhalation were
              quantitatively evaluated using intensive monitoring data of 51
              PM2.5-bound metals that were collected on three consecutive days,

              survey on LHD accreditation adoption. The study is an exploration
              of LHD accreditation de-adoption and of the contributions made to
              its understanding by the Performance Improvement Model. Result:
              The study found that top management team members are those who
              champion accreditation adoption, and that organizational
              structure and culture facilitate the staff's embracing of the
              change. The Performance Improvement Model was found to enhance
              the elucidation of the inner domain elements of Consolidated
              Framework for Implementation Research in the context of
              de-adoption of public health accreditation. Conclusion: Governing
              entities' policies and priorities appear to mediate whether the
              LHDs are able to continue accreditation pursuit. Lacking any of
              these driving forces appears to be associated with decisions to
              de-adoption of accreditation. Further work is necessary to
              discern specific elements mediating decisions to pursue
              accreditation. This study demonstrates the added knowledge of
              Performance Improvement Model (PIM) to the CFIR framework. A
              large scale study is called to further clarify and discern
              supports of specific to the needs of individual LHDs for their
              performance improvement effort. \copyright{} 2017 Wolters Kluwer

              to a critical need to unify guidelines for One Health studies.
              This report details the Checklist for One Health Epidemiological
              Reporting of Evidence (COHERE) to guide the design and
              publication format of future One Health studies. COHERE was
              developed by a core writing team and international expert review
              group that represents multiple disciplines, including human
              medicine, veterinary medicine, public health, allied
              professionals, clinical laboratory science, epidemiology, the
              social sciences, ecohealth and environmental health. The twin
              aims of the COHERE standards are to 1) improve the quality of
              reporting of observational or interventional epidemiological
              studies that collect and integrate data from humans, animals
              and/or vectors, and their environments; and 2) promote the
              concept that One Health studies should integrate knowledge from
              these three domains. The 19 standards in the COHERE checklist
              address descriptions of human populations, animal populations,
              environmental assessment, spatial and temporal relationships of
              data from the three domains, integration of analyses and

              isolated from nasal carriers in two teaching hospitals (Hajar and
              Kashani) in Shahrekord, southwestern Iran. Methods: In this
              cross-sectional study, 262 nasal specimens were obtained from
              healthcare staff. The disk-diffusion method was used to detect
              MRSA. Nine antibiotic disks were used to determine the antibiotic
              susceptibility pattern. Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec
              (SCCmec) types were identified by the multiplex polymerase chain
              reaction (PCR). The data analysis was performed using Fisher's
              exact test with SPSS software. Results: Forty-eight (18.8\%)
              specimens were identified as S. aureus, of which 30 (11.45\%)
              specimens were methicillin resistant. The nasal colonization rate
              of the MRSA isolates was not associated with age or gender (P >

              public health interventions available to avert
              vaccine-preventable diseases and deaths. Despite global progress
              in adolescent health, many adolescents in Africa still get sick
              and die from vaccine-preventable diseases due to lack of
              vaccination. Adolescents, parents and teachers are key players in
              the development and implementation of adolescent vaccination
              policies. Optimal knowledge, attitudes and practices towards
              adolescent vaccination among these key players may improve
              vaccine uptake among adolescents. We conducted a qualitative and
              quantitative systematic review on knowledge, attitudes and
              practices of adolescent vaccination among adolescents, parents
              and teachers in Africa. Methods We searched PubMed, Cochrane
              Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, Web of Science,
              WHOLIS, Africa Wide and CINAHL for eligible quantitative and
              qualitative primary studies with no time limits. We also checked
              reference lists of included studies for eligible studies and
              searched grey literature. Two authors independently screened the
              search outputs, selected studies and extracted data; resolving
              discrepancies by consensus and discussion. Qualitative data were
              analysed using thematic analyses where applicable, while analyses
              from quantitative studies used different methods based on the
              type of outcomes. Results We included 18 cross-sectional studies
              in this review. The included studies were conducted in 10 out of
              the 54 countries in Africa. The 18 studies focused on a wide
              range of adolescent vaccines. Thirteen studies evaluated vaccines
              against Human Papilloma Virus, while each of the remaining 5
              studies, evaluated vaccines against rabies, HIV, tetanus toxoid,
              tuberculosis and adolescent vaccines in general. Among the key
              players, we found low to moderate levels of knowledge about
              adolescent vaccination. Positive attitudes and practices towards
              adolescent vaccination, especially against Human Papilloma Virus
              were reported. Despite the low knowledge, our results showed high
              levels of acceptability to adolescent vaccination among
              adolescents, parents and teachers. Conclusions It was evident in
              our review that all key demographics (parents, adolescents and

              observed, in a hypothetical world, where the cancer of interest
              would be the only possible cause of death, is a key indicator in
              population-based cancer studies. Accounting for mortality due to
              other causes, it allows cross-country comparisons or trends
              analysis and provides a useful indicator for public health
              decision-making. The objective of this study was to show how the
              creation and formalization of a network comprising established
              research teams, which already had substantial and complementary
              experience in both cancer survival analysis and methodological

              Estimation of Net SURvival (CENSUR) working survival group is
              composed of international researchers highly skilled in
              biostatistics, methodology, and epidemiology, from different

              synergistic network capable of addressing problems in public
              health, for decision-makers at different levels; tools for those
              in charge of net survival analyses; a common methodology that
              makes unbiased cross-national comparisons of cancer survival
              feasible; transfer of methods for net survival estimations to
              other specific applications (clinical research, occupational
              epidemiology); and dissemination of results during an
              international training course. Conclusion The formalization of
              the international CENSUR working survival group was motivated by
              a need felt by scientists conducting population-based cancer

              demonstrate the concept of the interactive knowledge to action
              approach in order to foster sustainable implementation of an
              evidence-based physical activity programme for dementia
              prevention into practice. The approach and procedures will be
              introduced, and initial results of the pilot study GESTALT, with
              special regard to the interplay of science, politics and
              prevention practice, will be outlined. Methods: In the GESTALT
              project (2011-2014) the concept of interactive knowledge to
              action was realised through a cooperative planning approach that
              systematically engaged and involved stakeholders from science,
              politics and practice. Evaluation of the project's sustainability
              focused on 3 dimensions: target group, organisations and context.
              Target group analysis included assessment of changes in physical
              activity behaviour (n=75). Organisational and context evaluations
              included an analysis of relevant documentation of cooperative
              planning meetings, conduction of the programme, bilateral talks
              and further meetings. Results: In relation to the target group,
              the majority of participants (60\%) were committed to an active
              lifestyle 6 months after completion of the GESTALT programme.
              Regarding organisations and context, 14 partner organisations
              maintained active engagement in cooperative planning processes.
              After adapting the GESTALT programme to the context and needs of
              the organisations and participants, 5 organisations were able to
              implement it. These same organisations also continued to provide
              exercise classes for ex-participants of the initial GESTALT
              programme. Through developing partnerships, increasing publicity
              and attracting policy makers, resources for the sustainable
              implementation of the GESTALT project were obtained. Conclusion:
              The pilot study GESTALT shows that the concept of interactive
              knowledge to action has substantially contributed to the
              sustainability of a physical activity programme in the field of
              dementia prevention. For this purpose changes in local
              structures, as well as adaptations of the GESTALT programme to
              the existing structures of prevention practice had to be made.
              The approach of cooperative planning proved to be appropriate for
              the generation of knowledge in terms of practice-based evidence,
              and it favoured the reciprocal adaptation of the GESTALT
              programme and implementation contexts.",

              The National Institutes of Health has implemented a Big Data to
              Knowledge (BD2K) initiative that aims to develop and disseminate
              state of the art big data access tools and analytical methods.
              The National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR) is a new National
              Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute resource designed to provide big
              data resources to the sleep research community. The NSRR is a
              web-based data portal that aggregates, harmonizes, and organizes
              sleep and clinical data from thousands of individuals studied as
              part of cohort studies or clinical trials and provides the user a
              suite of tools to facilitate data exploration and data
              visualization. Each deidentified study record minimally includes
              the summary results of an overnight sleep study; annotation files
              with scored events; the raw physiological signals from the sleep
              record; and available clinical and physiological data. NSRR is
              designed to be interoperable with other public data resources
              such as the Biologic Specimen and Data Repository Information
              Coordinating Center Demographics (BioLINCC) data and analyzed
              with methods provided by the Research Resource for Complex
              Physiological Signals (PhysioNet). This article reviews the key
              objectives, challenges and operational solutions to addressing
              big data opportunities for sleep research in the context of the
              national sleep research agenda. It provides information to
              facilitate further interactions of the user community with NSRR,
              a community resource.",

  author   = "Steenkamp, M and Hutton, A E and Ranse, J C and Lund, A and

  abstract = "Introduction The science underpinning mass-gathering health (MGH)
              is developing rapidly. However, MGH terminology and concepts are
              not yet well defined or used consistently. These variations can
              complicate comparisons across settings. There is, therefore, a
              need to develop consensus and standardize concepts and data
              points to support the development of a robust MGH evidence-base
              for governments, event planners, responders, and researchers.
              This project explored the views and sought consensus of
              international MGH experts on previously published concepts around
              MGH to inform the development of a transnational minimum data set
              (MDS) with an accompanying data dictionary (DD). Report A
              two-round Delphi process was undertaken involving volunteers from
              the World Health Organization (WHO) Virtual Interdisciplinary
              Advisory Group (VIAG) on Mass Gatherings (MGs) and the MG section
              of the World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine
              (WADEM). The first online survey tested agreement on six key
              concepts: (1) using the term MG HEALTH; (2) purposes of the
              proposed MDS and DD; (3) event phases; (4) two MG population
              models; (5) a MGH conceptual diagram; and (6) a data matrix for
              organizing MGH data elements. Consensus was defined as $\geq$80\%
              agreement. Round 2 presented five refined MGH principles based on
              Round 1 input that was analyzed using descriptive statistics and
              content analysis. Thirty-eight participants started Round 1 with
              36 completing the survey and 24 (65\% of 36) completing Round 2.
              Agreement was reached on: the term MGH (n=35/38; 92\%); the
              stated purposes for the MDS (n=38/38; 100\%); the two MG
              population models (n=31/36; 86\% and n=30/36; 83\%,
              respectively); and the event phases (n=34/36; 94\%). Consensus
              was not achieved on the overall conceptual MGH diagram (n=25/37;
              67\%) and the proposed matrix to organize data elements (n=28/37;
              77\%). In Round 2, agreement was reached on all the proposed
              principles and revisions, except on the MGH diagram (n=18/24;
              75\%). Discussion/Conclusions Event health stakeholders require
              sound data upon which to build a robust MGH evidence-base. The
              move towards standardization of data points and/or reporting
              items of interest will strengthen the development of such an
              evidence-base from which governments, researchers, clinicians,
              and event planners could benefit. There is substantial agreement
              on some broad concepts underlying MGH amongst an international
              group of MG experts. Refinement is needed regarding an overall
              conceptual diagram and proposed matrix for organizing data
              elements. Steenkamp M, Hutton AE, Ranse JC, Lund A, Turris SA,

              studies published between 1979 and 2015. We found 180 papers from
              63 journals and noted that spatial epidemiology of cancer has
              been addressed with more emphasis during the last decade with
              research based on data mostly extracted from cancer registries
              and official mortality statistics. In general, the research
              questions present in the reviewed papers can be classified into
              three different sets: i) analysis of spatial distribution of

              of the passage of development of the science and technology
              through analysis of the scientific publications from a developing
              country by taking into account its state of higher education and
              the unique political, economic and geo-bio-environmental
              conditions. It deals with Nepal considering its scientific output
              during 1966--2016 reflected as publications indexed in the Web of
              Science Database. Preliminary examination of the publication
              record for Nepal reveals a number of the following
              characteristics: (1) low volume, negligible growth and lack of
              distinct trend until 1989; (2) a marked growth followed by
              stagnation linked to political instability during the next 15
              years; and (3) recovery and accelerated growth thereafter.
              Research publications during 2004--2013 increased thrice compared
              to 1994--2003, with expansion and shifts in disciplinary profile
              expressed in Essential Science Indicators 22 fields. Detailed
              bibliometric analysis of the 2004--2013 publications (3011
              articles and reviews) from Nepal suggests the citation impact of
              about the world average, but very high (76\%) average
              international co-authorship. The disciplinary profile is diverse
              judging from seven most productive fields (clinical medicine,
              plant and animal science, environment/ecology, geosciences,
              agricultural sciences, and chemistry) with 4--40\% national
              disciplinary share. Clinical medicine, geosciences and
              agricultural sciences exhibit relatively high impact. Fields with
              the smaller share (< 3\%), such as molecular biology and
              genetics, economics and business, psychiatry and psychology,
              materials science, and biology and biochemistry, exhibit citation
              impact distinctly higher than the world average. Publications
              from Nepal show the presence of a vast international
              collaborative network that is dominated by authors affiliated to
              institutions in the USA, India, UK, Japan, South Korea and
              Germany. Based on the analysis of the disciplinary diversity and
              the national versus global relative disciplinary shares, Nepal's
              publication profile is inferred to be a hybrid of the
              `bio-environmental' and `western' models. Concerning the state of
              the development of science and technology in Nepal during
              2004--2013, the high dependence on international collaboration in
              the internationally visible publications in most of the
              bio-environmental, physico-chemical and engineering fields points
              to basically a `building-up stage'. In clinical medicine (with a
              large share of public health) and geosciences, however, Nepal has
              demonstrated research strengths evident from the high citation
              impact in these fields. Moreover, the available data suggest that
              significant advances were made in higher education sector in both
              fields during the last 25 years. Despite the notable negative
              effect of the prolonged domestic armed political conflict on the

              field-based sciences, the post-conflict period shows signs of
              recovery in both domestic and international collaborations
              leading to again an accelerated growth in scientific

  abstract = "Objective: Although there is evidence that dengue virus is
              circulating in Tanzania, the country lacks a dengue surveillance
              system. Consequently, the true estimate of dengue seroprevalence,
              as well as the incidence in the population, the frequency and
              magnitude of outbreaks is unknown. This study therefore sought to
              systematically review available dengue data from Tanzania.
              Methods: The systematic review was conducted and reported using
              the PRISMA tool. Five databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science,
              WHOLIS and Google Scholar) were searched for articles using
              various keywords on the illness, data and geographical location.
              Identified articles were assessed for inclusion based on
              predefined eligibility criteria. Data were extracted from
              included articles, analysed and reported. Results: Based on the
              10 seroprevalence studies in defined populations with estimates
              of acute confirmed infections that were included in the review,
              the estimated seroprevalence of past dengue infection in Tanzania
              ranged from 50.6\% in a health facility-based study to 11\% in a
              population-based study. Acute confirmed infections of dengue were
              estimated to be as high as 38.2\% of suspected cases. Only one
              study reported on an outbreak. Conclusions: It is evident that
              dengue needs to become part of regular disease surveillance in
              Tanzania. Control measures need to be instituted with a focus on
              building human resource capacity and integrating dengue control
              measures in ongoing health programmes, for both preventive and
              curative interventions. Systematic reviews are valuable in
              assessing health issues when surveillance data are not available.

              one of the highest rates of teen pregnancy among all ethnic and
              racial groups in the United States. To enhance the effectiveness
              of interventions for diverse Latino populations in the US, it is
              crucial to assess the community's understanding of the etiology
              of the problem of adolescent pregnancy and to implement programs
              that reflect the local community's beliefs and preferences. We
              present findings from six focus groups held with parents (n =
              18), teachers (n = 23) and school stakeholders (n = 8) regarding
              teen pregnancy prevention among Latino youth at a high school

              data iteratively using a template organizing approach. A
              consensus emerged across the groups regarding content that
              emphasized respect for oneself and one's family, a focus on
              personal and shared responsibility in reproductive health
              behavior, information about the ``realities'' or consequences
              associated with engaging in sexual activity, and information

              include a parental education component reflects the community's

              socialization and development of adolescent sexual behavior, a

              and needed amid accelerating concern about insect trends in the
              Anthropocene. The growing recognition that insect populations may
              be in decline has given rise to a renewed call for insect
              population monitoring by scientists, and a desire from the
              broader public to participate in insect surveys. However, due to
              the immense diversity of insects and a vast assortment of data
              collection methods, there is a general lack of standardization in
              insect monitoring methods, such that a sudden and unplanned
              expansion of data collection may fail to meet its ecological
              potential or conservation needs without a coordinated focus on
              standards and best practices. To begin to address this problem,
              we provide simple guidelines for maximizing return on proven
              inventory methods that will provide insect benchmarking data
              suitable for a variety of ecological responses, including
              occurrence and distribution, phenology, abundance and biomass,
              and diversity and species composition. To track these responses,
              we present seven primary insect sampling methods---malaise
              trapping, light trapping, pan trapping, pitfall trappings,
              beating sheets, acoustic monitoring, and active visual
              surveys---and recommend standards while highlighting examples of
              model programs. For each method, we discuss key topics such as
              recommended spatial and temporal scales of sampling, important
              metadata to track, and degree of replication needed to produce
              rigorous estimates of ecological responses. We additionally
              suggest protocols for scalable insect monitoring, from backyards
              to national parks. Overall, we aim to compile a resource that can
              be used by diverse individuals and organizations seeking to
              initiate or improve insect monitoring programs in this era of
              rapid change.",

              during this time period in an attempt to understand the weight
              and direction of the scientific literature. Our results indicate
              that at least 685 papers have been published in peer-reviewed
              scientific journals that are relevant to assessing the impacts of
              UNGD. 84\% of public health studies contain findings that
              indicate public health hazards, elevated risks, or adverse health
              outcomes; 69\% of water quality studies contain findings that
              indicate potential, positive association, or actual incidence of
              water contamination; and 87\% of air quality studies contain
              findings that indicate elevated air pollutant emissions and/or
              atmospheric concentrations. This paper demonstrates that the
              weight of the findings in the scientific literature indicates
              hazards and elevated risks to human health as well as possible
              adverse health outcomes associated with UNGD. There are

              reports from North America, presents many new records on the
              occurrence of Trichomonas gallinae in North American columbiform
              birds. Evidence is presented that the .infection is present
              throughout most of the United States and on occasion has reached
              epizootic proportions in mourning doves and band-tiled pigeons in
              isolated areas. An extensive epizootic is reported involving
              several thousand eastern mourning doves in the Southeastern
              States during the summer of 1950. Although probably the chief
              means of transmission is from. parent to offspring in columbiform
              birds (and the occurrence of infection in nestling mourning doves
              demonstrates that this mode of inoculation occurs) in severe
              epizootics there also is undoubtedly a transmission by
              contamination of water or food besides, or as well as, the parent
              to offspring transfers. When T. gallinae is implanted in clean
              pigeons it becomes evident that there is a variety of strains of
              the organisms and that they differ considerably in virulence.
              Some strains may kill almost every recipient, while others,
              though they readily infect, never produce the slightest
              discomfort or pathology. Nonlethal infections produce an immunity
              to all strains tested. In some cases, however, when these
              double-strain infections are further inoculated into. clean
              birds, the effects of either the nonlethal or the killing strain
              may predominate. The mechanism by which this virulence acts in
              the blrds is undoubtedly an important factor in determining the
              morbidity or mortality that may occur in a population. The
              prevalence of trichomoniasis in native pigeons and doves presents
              many practical as well as academic problems. Ultimate application
              of control measures, evenon an experimental basis, must await
              further knowledge of many more basic facts.",

  abstract = "Background: Despite control efforts, human schistosomiasis
              remains prevalent throughout Africa, Asia, and South America. The
              global schistosomiasis burden has changed little since the new
              anthelmintic drug, praziquantel, promised widespread control.
              Methodology: We evaluated large-scale schistosomiasis control
              attempts over the past century and across the globe by
              identifying factors that predict control program success: snail
              control (e.g., molluscicides or biological control), mass drug
              administrations (MDA) with praziquantel, or a combined strategy
              using both. For data, we compiled historical information on
              control tactics and their quantitative outcomes for all 83
              countries and territories in which: (i) schistosomiasis was
              allegedly endemic during the 20th century, and (ii)
              schistosomiasis remains endemic, or (iii) schistosomiasis has
              been ``eliminated,'' or is ``no longer endemic,'' or transmission
              has been interrupted. Principal Findings: Widespread snail
              control reduced prevalence by 92 $\pm$ 5\% (N = 19) vs. 37 $\pm$
              7\% (N = 29) for programs using little or no snail control. In
              addition, ecological, economic, and political factors contributed
              to schistosomiasis elimination. For instance, snail control was
              most common and widespread in wealthier countries and when
              control began earlier in the 20th century.
              Conclusions/Significance: Snail control has been the most
              effective way to reduce schistosomiasis prevalence. Despite
              evidence that snail control leads to long-term disease reduction
              and elimination, most current schistosomiasis control efforts
              emphasize MDA using praziquantel over snail control. Combining
              drug-based control programs with affordable snail control seems
              the best strategy for eliminating schistosomiasis. \copyright{}

               are key metrics often used to assess the efficacy of restoration

               process, quantified by an expert manually sorting and weighing
               arthropod specimens. We present a tool to accelerate bulk
               arthropod classification and biomass estimates utilizing machine
               learning methods for computer vision. Our approach requires
               pre-sorted arthropod samples to create a training dataset. We
               construct a dataset considering 18 terrestrial arthropod
               functional groups collected in southern Ontario, Canada. The
               dataset contains 517 high-resolution images with approximately
               20 individuals per image taken from either a petri dish or a
               bulk tray. Our tool uses the watershed algorithm to obtain
               precisely cropped individuals without any object annotations.
               After manually sorting cropped images of biological ?debris? and
               petri dish edges, three classifiers, DenseNet121, ResNet101 and
               MobileNetv2, each with trade-offs of computational efficiency
               versus accuracy, are trained and compared to predict arthropod
               functional groups for each cropped individual. To calculate
               biomass, we compare seven linear and nonlinear models
               considering the arthropod pixel masks obtained using the
               watershed algorithm, in combination with images of a single
               function group with recorded weights, to calculate the per pixel
               density per functional group. From our experimentation, we
               recommend using DenseNet121 as it had the highest top-1
               functional group classification accuracy, likely a result of
               being the model with the largest number of parameters, with
               86.14\% considering the 20 labelled classes (18 arthropods plus
               debris and petri dish edge) in comparison to ResNet101 (85.10\%)
               and MobileNetv2 (84.94\%). For biomass estimation, we recommend
               using the average per pixel density which had the highest ranked
               performance considering both total error, 0.043 g (0.855\%
               error), and cumulative class-specific error, 1.62 g (40.67\%
               average error across all classes), in comparison to the total
               ground truth biomass of 5.10 g. Our estimated Simpson's Index of
               Diversity was 0.9404 in comparison to the ground truth 0.9408.
               Our method simultaneously classifies >1,000 arthropods to
               functional groupings while estimating total and class specific
               biomass, without any computer vision bounding box or mask
               annotations, all from a single photo. We release our code and
               dataset to further research efforts in computer vision for
               arthropod classification.",

  abstract = "Understanding how the biodiversity of freshwater fish assemblages
              changes over time is an important challenge. Until recently most
              emphasis has been on taxonomic diversity, but it is now clear
              that measures of functional diversity (FD) can shed new light on
              the mechanisms that underpin this temporal change. Fish
              biologists use different currencies, such as numerical abundance
              and biomass, to measure the abundance of fish species.
              Nonetheless, because they are not necessarily equivalent, these
              alternative currencies have the potential to reveal different
              insights into trends of FD in natural assemblages. In this study,
              the authors asked how conclusions about temporal trends in FD are
              influenced by the way in which the abundance of species has been
              quantified. To do this, the authors computed two informative
              metrics, for each currency, for 16 freshwater fish assemblages in
              Trinidad's Northern Range that had been surveyed repeatedly over
              5 years. The authors found that numerical abundance and biomass
              uncover different directional trends in these assemblages for
              each facet of FD, and as such inform hypotheses about the ways in
              which these systems are being restructured. On the basis of these
              results, the authors concluded that a combined approach, in which
              both currencies are used, contributes to our understanding of the
              ecological processes that are involved in biodiversity change in
              freshwater fish assemblages.",

              these reports come from a wide range of insect taxa and regions,
              the evidence to assess the extent of the phenomenon is sparse.
              Insect populations are challenging to study, and most monitoring
              methods are labor intensive and inefficient. Advances in computer
              vision and deep learning provide potential new solutions to this
              global challenge. Cameras and other sensors can effectively,
              continuously, and noninvasively perform entomological
              observations throughout diurnal and seasonal cycles. The physical
              appearance of specimens can also be captured by automated imaging
              in the laboratory. When trained on these data, deep learning
              models can provide estimates of insect abundance, biomass, and
              diversity. Further, deep learning models can quantify variation
              in phenotypic traits, behavior, and interactions. Here, we
              connect recent developments in deep learning and computer vision
              to the urgent demand for more cost-efficient monitoring of
              insects and other invertebrates. We present examples of

              ecological information and discuss the challenges that lie ahead
              for the implementation of such solutions in entomology. We

               increased woody vegetation cover. However, areas along the
               Hudson Bay Lowlands that are over-grazed by hyper-abundant
               lesser snow geese are experiencing drastic losses of grass,

               proportional ground cover and habitat patch characteristic at a
               subarctic supratidal marsh that was largely vacated by breeding
               snow geese over a decade ago. We found no evidence of habitat

               propagates degradation of habitat long after their direct
               removal of vegetation through foraging. Over a 35 year period,
               we documented a 46\% reduction in graminoid cover and an 84\%

              science is a powerful tool for tackling many of the challenges
              faced in the field of conservation biology. We describe the two
              interwoven paths by which citizen science can improve
              conservation efforts, natural resource management, and
              environmental protection. The first path includes building

              science is currently used and describe the investments needed to

              citizen science, but one must be careful to match the needs for
              science and public involvement with the right type of citizen
              science project and the right method of public
              participation.3.Citizen science is a rigorous process of
              scientific discovery, indistinguishable from conventional science

  abstract  = "Aim: Although urbanization impacts many species, there is little
               information on the patterns of occurrences of threatened species
               in urban relative to non-urban areas. By assessing the extent of
               the distribution of threatened species across all Australian
               cities, we aim to investigate the currently under-utilized
               opportunity that cities present for national biodiversity
               conservation. Location: Australian mainland, Tasmania and
               offshore islands. Methods: Distributions of Australia's 1643
               legally protected terrestrial species (hereafter 'threatened
               species') were compiled. We assessed the extent to which they
               overlapped with 99 cities (of more than 10,000 people), with all
               non-urban areas, and with simulated 'dummy' cities which covered
               the same area and bioregion as the true cities but were
               non-urban. We analysed differences between animals and plants,
               and examined variability within these groups using species
               accumulation modelling. Threatened species richness of true
               versus dummy cities was analysed using generalized linear
               mixed-effects models. Results: Australian cities support
               substantially more nationally threatened animal and plant
               species than all other non-urban areas on a unit-area basis.
               Thirty per cent of threatened species were found to occur in
               cities. Distribution patterns differed between plants and
               animals: individual threatened plant species were generally
               found in fewer cities than threatened animal species, yet plants
               were more likely to have a greater proportion of their
               distribution in urban areas than animals. Individual cities
               tended to contain unique suites of threatened species,
               especially threatened plants. The analysis of true versus dummy
               cities demonstrated that, even after accounting for factors such
               as net primary productivity and distance to the coast, cities
               still consistently supported a greater number of threatened
               species. Main conclusions: This research highlights that
               Australian cities are important for the conservation of
               threatened species, and that the species assemblages of
               individual cities are relatively distinct. National conservation
               policy should recognize that cities play an integral role when
               planning for and managing threatened species.",

              science is a powerful tool for tackling many of the challenges
              faced in the field of conservation biology. We describe the two
              interwoven paths by which citizen science can improve
              conservation efforts, natural resource management, and
              environmental protection. The first path includes building
              scientific knowledge, while the other path involves informing
              policy and encouraging public action. We explore how citizen
              science is currently used and describe the investments needed to
              create a citizen science program. We find that:1.Citizen science
              already contributes substantially to many domains of science,
              including conservation, natural resource, and environmental
              science. Citizen science informs natural resource management,
              environmental protection, and policymaking and fosters public
              input and engagement.2.Many types of projects can benefit from
              citizen science, but one must be careful to match the needs for
              science and public involvement with the right type of citizen
              science project and the right method of public
              participation.3.Citizen science is a rigorous process of
              scientific discovery, indistinguishable from conventional science
              apart from the participation of volunteers. When properly
              designed, carried out, and evaluated, citizen science can provide

@ARTICLE{McKinney2006-qe,
  title    = "Urbanization as a major cause of biotic homogenization",
  author   = "McKinney, Michael L",
  abstract = "When measured by extent and intensity, urbanization is one of the
              most homogenizing of all major human activities. Cities
              homogenize the physical environment because they are built to
              meet the relatively narrow needs of just one species, our own.
              Also, cities are maintained for centuries in a disequilibrium
              state from the local natural environment by the importation of
              vast resources of energy and materials. Consequently, as cities
              expand across the planet, biological homogenization increases
              because the same ``urban-adaptable'' species become increasingly
              widespread and locally abundant in cities across the planet. As
              urbanization often produces a local gradient of disturbance, one
              can also observe a gradient of homogenization. Synanthropic
              species adapted to intensely modified built habitats at the urban
              core are ``global homogenizers'', found in cities worldwide.
              However, many suburban and urban fringe habitats are occupied by
              native species that become regionally widespread. These suburban
              adapters typically consist of early successional plants and
              ``edge'' animal species such as mesopredator mammals, and
              ground-foraging, omnivorous and frugivorous birds that can
              utilize gardens, forest fragments and many other habitats
              available in the suburbs. A basic conservation challenge is that
              urban biota is often quite diverse and very abundant. The
              intentional and unintentional importation of species adapted to
              urban habitats, combined with many food resources imported for
              human use, often produces local species diversity and abundance
              that is often equal to or greater than the surrounding landscape.
              With the important exception of low-income areas, urban human
              populations often inhabit richly cultivated suburban habitats
              with a relatively high local floral and faunal diversity and/or
              abundance without awareness of the global impoverishment caused
              by urbanization. Equally challenging is that, because so many
              urban species are immigrants adapting to city habitats, urbanites
              of all income levels become increasingly disconnected from local
              indigenous species and their natural ecosystems. Urban
              conservation should therefore focus on promoting preservation and
              restoration of local indigenous species.",

              the increasing anthropogenic pressures on biodiversity in urban
              areas. While the cost of broad-scale monitoring by professionals
              may be prohibitive, citizen science (also referred to as
              community science) will likely play an important role in
              understanding biodiversity responses to urbanization into the
              future. Here, we present a framework that relies on broad-scale
              citizen science data ---- collected through iNaturalist ---- to
              quantify (1) species-specific responses to urbanization on a
              continuous scale, capitalizing on globally-available VIIRS
              night-time lights data; and (2) community-level measures of the
              urbanness of a given biological community that can be aggregated
              to any spatial unit relevant for policy-decisions. We demonstrate
              the potential utility of this framework in the Boston
              metropolitan region, using >1000 species aggregated across 87
              towns throughout the region. Of the most common species, our
              species-specific urbanness measures highlighted the expected
              difference between native and non-native species. Further, our
              biological community-level urbanness measures ---- aggregated by
              towns ---- negatively correlated with enhanced vegetation indices
              within a town and positively correlated with the area of
              impervious surface within a town. We conclude by demonstrating
              how towns can be `ranked' promoting a framework where towns can
              be compared based on whether they over- or under-perform in the
              urbanness of their community relative to other towns. Ultimately,
              biodiversity conservation in urban environments will best succeed
              with robust, repeatable, and interpretable measures of
              biodiversity responses to urbanization, and involving the broader
              public in the derivation and tracking of these responses will
              likely result in increased bioliteracy and conservation

               processes. The purpose of this paper is to examine how well data
               from DMSP/OLS nighttime lights (NTL) can identify different
               types of urbanization processes. Although data from DMSP/OLS NTL

               there is no systematic assessment of how well these data

               NTL have a high accuracy (93\%) of characterizing these changes.
               There is also a relatively high error of commission (42\%),
               where NTL identified urban change when no change occurred. This
               leads to an overestimation of urbanization by NTL. Our analysis

               urbanization in developed countries, but is less accurate in

  abstract = "Biodiversity sampling is labor intensive, and a substantial
              fraction of a biota is often represented by species of very low
              abundance, which typically remain undetected by biodiversity
              surveys. Statistical methods are widely used to estimate the
              asymptotic number of species present, including species not yet
              detected. Additional sampling is required to detect and identify
              these species, but richness estimators do not indicate how much
              sampling effort (additional individuals or samples) would be
              necessary to reach the asymptote of the species accumulation
              curve. Here we develop the first statistically rigorous
              nonparametric method for estimating the minimum number of
              additional individuals, samples, or sampling area required to
              detect any arbitrary proportion (including 100\%) of the
              estimated asymptotic species richness. The method uses the Chao1
              and Chao2 nonparametric estimators of asymptotic richness, which
              are based on the frequencies of rare species in the original
              sampling data. To evaluate the performance of the proposed
              method, we randomly subsampled individuals or quadrats from two
              large biodiversity inventories (light trap captures of
              Lepidoptera in Great Britain and censuses of woody plants on
              Barro Colorado Island [BCI], Panama). The simulation results
              suggest that the method performs well but is slightly
              conservative for small sample sizes. Analyses of the BCI results
              suggest that the method is robust to nonindependence arising from
              small-scale spatial aggregation of species occurrences. When the
              method was applied to seven published biodiversity data sets, the
              additional sampling effort necessary to capture all the estimated
              species ranged from 1.05 to 10.67 times the original sample
              (median approximately equal to 2.23). Substantially less effort
              is needed to detect 90\% of the species (0.33-1.10 times the
              original effort; median approximately equal to 0.80). An Excel
              spreadsheet tool is provided for calculating necessary sampling

              evenness of species relative abundances, and the total number of
              species remains limited. Using individual-based rarefaction
              curves, we show how expected positive relationships among changes
              in abundance, evenness and richness arise, and how they can break
              down. We then examined interdependencies between changes in
              abundance, evenness and richness in more than 1100 assemblages
              sampled either through time or across space. As predicted,
              richness changes were greatest when abundance and evenness
              changed in the same direction, and countervailing changes in
              abundance and evenness acted to constrain the magnitude of
              changes in species richness. Site-to-site differences in
              abundance, evenness, and richness were often decoupled, and
              pairwise relationships between these components across
              assemblages were weak. In contrast, changes in species richness
              and relative abundance were strongly correlated for assemblages
              varying through time. Temporal changes in local biodiversity
              showed greater inertia and stronger relationships between the
              component changes when compared to site-to-site variation.
              Overall, local variation in assemblage diversity was rarely due
              to repeated passive samples from an approximately static species
              abundance distribution. Instead, changing species relative
              abundances often dominated local variation in diversity.
              Moreover, how changing relative abundances combined with changes
              to total abundance frequently determined the magnitude of
              richness changes. Embracing the interdependencies between

               maps have been used in increasingly sophisticated curve-fitting
               analyses, but these methods have not brought us much closer to a
               mechanistic understanding of the patterns. During the past two
               decades, macroecologists have successfully addressed technical
               problems posed by spatial autocorrelation, intercorrelation of
               predictor variables and non-linearity. However, curve-fitting
               approaches are problematic because most theoretical models in
               macroecology do not make quantitative predictions, and they do
               not incorporate interactions among multiple forces. As an
               alternative, we propose a mechanistic modelling approach. We
               describe computer simulation models of the stochastic origin,
               spread, and extinction of species' geographical ranges in an
               environmentally heterogeneous, gridded domain and describe
               progress to date regarding their implementation. The output from
               such a general simulation model (GSM) would, at a minimum,
               consist of the simulated distribution of species ranges on a
               map, yielding the predicted number of species in each grid cell
               of the domain. In contrast to curve-fitting analysis, simulation
               modelling explicitly incorporates the processes believed to be
               affecting the geographical ranges of species and generates a
               number of quantitative predictions that can be compared to
               empirical patterns. We describe three of the 'control knobs' for
               a GSM that specify simple rules for dispersal, evolutionary
               origins and environmental gradients. Binary combinations of
               different knob settings correspond to eight distinct simulation
               models, five of which are already represented in the literature
               of macroecology. The output from such a GSM will include the
               predicted species richness per grid cell, the range size
               frequency distribution, the simulated phylogeny and simulated
               geographical ranges of the component species, all of which can
               be compared to empirical patterns. Challenges to the development
               of the GSM include the measurement of goodness of fit (GOF)
               between observed data and model predictions, as well as the
               estimation, optimization and interpretation of the model
               parameters. The simulation approach offers new insights into the
               origin and maintenance of species richness patterns, and may
               provide a common framework for investigating the effects of
               contemporary climate, evolutionary history and geometric
               constraints on global biodiversity gradients. With further
               development, the GSM has the potential to provide a conceptual

                 within and across multiple cities from different types of
                 urbanization. Methods. Here we utilize a growing
                 resource---citizen science data. We analyzed 66,209
                 observations representing 5,209 species generated by the City
                 Nature Challenge project on the iNaturalist platform, in
                 conjunction with remote sensing (NLCD2011) environmental data,
                 to test for urban homogenization at increasing levels of urban
                 intensity across 14 metropolitan cities in the United States.
                 Results. Based on community composition analyses, we found
                 that while urban homogenization occurs to an extent, urban
                 biodiversity is often much more a reflection of the regional
                 specificity of taxa. On the other hand, we also found that the
                 most commonly observed species are often shared between cities
                 and are non-endemic and/or have a distribution facilitated by
                 humans. This study highlights the value of citizen science
                 data in answering questions in urban ecology.",

              conserving urban biodiversity remains controversial. How much of
              a fixed budget should be spent on conservation in urban versus
              nonurban landscapes? The answer should depend on the goals that
              drive our conservation actions, yet proponents of urban
              conservation often fail to specify the motivation for protecting
              urban biodiversity. This is an important shortcoming on several
              fronts, including a missed opportunity to make a stronger appeal
              to those who believe conservation biology should focus
              exclusively on more natural, wilder landscapes. We argue that
              urban areas do offer an important venue for conservation biology,
              but that we must become better at choosing and articulating our
              goals. We explored seven possible motivations for urban
              biodiversity conservation: preserving local biodiversity,
              creating stepping stones to nonurban habitat, understanding and
              facilitating responses to environmental change, conducting
              environmental education, providing ecosystem services, fulfilling
              ethical responsibilities, and improving human well-being. To
              attain all these goals, challenges must be faced that are common
              to the urban environment, such as localized pollution, disruption
              of ecosystem structure, and limited availability of land. There
              are, however, also challenges specific only to particular goals,
              meaning that different goals will require different approaches
              and actions. This highlights the importance of specifying the

  abstract  = "The world is rapidly urbanizing, but there is no single
               urbanization process. Rather, urban areas in different regions
               of the world are undergoing myriad types of transformation
               processes. The purpose of this paper is to examine how well data
               from DMSP/OLS nighttime lights (NTL) can identify different
               types of urbanization processes. Although data from DMSP/OLS NTL
               are increasingly used for the study of urban areas, to date
               there is no systematic assessment of how well these data
               identify different types of urban change. Here, we randomly
               select 240 sample locations distributed across all world regions
               to generate urbanization typologies with the DMSP/OLS NTL data
               and use Google Earth imagery to assess the validity of the NTL

               NTL have a high accuracy (93\%) of characterizing these changes.
               There is also a relatively high error of commission (42\%),
               where NTL identified urban change when no change occurred. This
               leads to an overestimation of urbanization by NTL. Our analysis
               shows that time series NTL data more accurately identifies
               urbanization in developed countries, but is less accurate in

               underpin those benefits are inconsistently quantified in the
               literature. There remain substantial knowledge gaps about the
               level of service supported by less studied GI types, e.g.
               cemeteries, or less-studied ecosystem services, e.g. noise
               mitigation. Decision-makers and planners in cities often face
               conflicting or incomplete information on the effectiveness of
               GI, particularly on their ability to provide a suite of
               co-benefits. Here, we describe a feature-based typology of GI
               which combines elements of land cover, land use and both
               ecological and social function. It is consistent with user
               requirements on mapping, and with the needs of models which can
               conduct more detailed ecosystem service assessments which can
               guide NBS design. We provide an evidence synthesis based on
               published literature, which scores the ability of each GI type
               to deliver a suite of ecosystem services. In the multivariate
               analysis of the typology scores, the main axis of variation
               differentiates between constructed (or hybrid) GI types designed
               primarily for water flow management (delivering relatively few
               services) and more natural green GI with trees, or blue GI such
               as lakes and the sea, which deliver a more multi-functional set
               of regulating services. The most multi-functional GI on this
               axis also score highest for biodiversity. The second element of
               variation separates those GI which support very few cultural
               services and those which score highly in enabling physical
               wellbeing and social interaction and, to a lesser extent,
               restoring capacities. Together the typology and
               multi-functionality matrix provide a much needed assessment for
               less studied GI types, and allow planners and decision-makers to
               make a-priori assessments of the relative ability of different
               GI as part of NBS to address urban challenges.",

              having multiple years of data.A completely novel method is
              presented that not only has no requirement for long-term datasets
              but can divide communities into multiple groups. It is based on
              probability a species is present, calculated using Simpson's

              sequential Simpson's index method was applied to species data

              invertebrate groups---Diptera, Hemiptera and Arachnida---together
              with total invertebrates and total biomass of (a) coppice species
              (sweet chestnut Castanea sativa and birch Betula pendula), (b)
              coppice age, (c) mature coppice understorey species (hazel
              Corylus avellana, hornbeam Carpinus betulus and sweet chestnut),
              living under oak Quercus standards at the Blean Woods complex in
              Kent. Generally birch coppice, irrespective of age, had the
              highest densities and biomass of the invertebrate groups studied.
              Middle-aged (6--7 year old) sweet chestnut coppice had the lowest
              density of invertebrates, although between-age class differences
              were significant in only a few cases. The age of birch coppice
              had no clear effect on invertebrate abundance and sample biomass.
              The species of coppice understorey in mature stands under oak
              standards had a significant effect on invertebrate abundance and
              sample biomass in the understorey. Generally densities and
              biomass values were highest in hornbeam and lowest in sweet
              chestnut. Total invertebrate densities and total biomass values
              were between 5--8 times higher and between 3--12 times higher,
              respectively, in hornbeam than in sweet chestnut understorey. The

  abstract  = "Biodiversity continues to decline in the face of increasing
               anthropogenic pressures such as habitat destruction,
               exploitation, pollution and introduction of alien species.
               Existing global databases of species' threat status or
               population time series are dominated by charismatic species. The
               collation of datasets with broad taxonomic and biogeographic
               extents, and that support computation of a range of biodiversity
               indicators, is necessary to enable better understanding of
               historical declines and to project - and avert - future
               declines. We describe and assess a new database of more than 1.6
               million samples from 78 countries representing over 28,000
               species, collated from existing spatial comparisons of
               local-scale biodiversity exposed to different intensities and
               types of anthropogenic pressures, from terrestrial sites around
               the world. The database contains measurements taken in 208 (of
               814) ecoregions, 13 (of 14) biomes, 25 (of 35) biodiversity
               hotspots and 16 (of 17) megadiverse countries. The database
               contains more than 1\% of the total number of all species
               described, and more than 1\% of the described species within
               many taxonomic groups - including flowering plants, gymnosperms,
               birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, beetles, lepidopterans and
               hymenopterans. The dataset, which is still being added to, is
               therefore already considerably larger and more representative
               than those used by previous quantitative models of biodiversity
               trends and responses. The database is being assembled as part of
               the PREDICTS project (Projecting Responses of Ecological
               Diversity In Changing Terrestrial Systems -
               http://www.predicts.org.uk). We make site-level summary data

              the availability of high-quality urban tree data. While these
              data are numerous, they are not available in an easily
              accessible, centralized place. To fill this gap, we aggregated
              public and private data into a single, comprehensive inventory of
              urban trees in California called the California Urban Forest
              (CUF) Inventory. These data are offered to the public (aggregated
              to ZIP code) via an online data portal, which at the time of
              publication contained over 6.6 million urban tree records. In
              this study, we first describe the assembly and utility of the
              inventory. Then, we conduct the most comprehensive assessment of
              the diversity and structure of California's urban forest to date
              at statewide, regional, and local spatial scales. These analyses
              demonstrate that California's urban forests are highly diverse
              and among the most diverse urban forests in the world. We present
              a new and intuitive metric of species diversity, the top
              diversity or TD-50 index, which represents the cumulative number
              of species accounting for the top 50 \% abundance of trees in an
              urban forest. We used species abundance data from 81
              well-inventoried cities to demonstrate that the TD-50 index was a
              robust metric of diversity and a good predictor of comprehensive
              metrics like the Shannon Index. We also found that small-statured
              trees, such as crape myrtles (Lagerstroemia cv.) dominate
              California's urban forests. This aggregated inventory of one of
              the world's largest urban forests provides the data necessary to
              assess the structure, diversity, and value of California's urban
              forests at multiple spatial scales. The inventory's presentation
              to the public and the information that can be gained from its

              scales within agricultural ecosystems, and thereby provide a
              means to investigate the influence of changing management
              practice on biological diversity at different scales within the
              agro-ecosystem. Surveys of grassland plant species at field
              level, parasitoid Hymenoptera at the field and farm scale, and
              bird populations and habitats at farm scale were carried out on
              119 grass-based farms across three regions in the Republic of
              Ireland. In addition, habitat richness and aquatic
              macroinvertebrates were quantified at landscape scale.
              Agricultural intensity on the surveyed farms was quantified by
              mean farm stocking rate, calculated as livestock units per ha
              (LU/ha), and generalised linear mixed models used to evaluate
              relationships between stocking rate and the incidence of chosen
              bioindicator groups. Field scale bioindicators (plant species
              richness and parasitoid taxon richness and abundance) were
              negatively associated with mean farm stocking rate. Over much of
              its observed range, mean farm stocking rate was positively
              associated with total bird species richness and abundance, and
              the species richness and abundance of farmland bird indicator
              species recorded in the winter season. However, these
              relationships were quadratic, and above a relatively high upper
              limit of 2.5--3.5LU/ha, further increase in farm stocking rate
              had a negative influence. Results demonstrate that different
              bioindicators measured at different spatial scales vary in their
              response to agricultural intensity. The lack of a consistent
              bioindicator response to farm stocking rate suggests that within
              predominantly farmed regions, maximising biodiversity requires a
              careful targeting and monitoring with bioindicator taxa that are
              informative of influences at relevant operational scales. The
              insights provided may then be much more informative for the
              design and implementation of agri-environment measures that

                  forests, that fits into the size of a tennis court. The
                  forest is not just an pleasant spot for butterflies, birds,
                  bees and small mammals; it is a great place for people too.
                  In the outdoor classroom, children learn about nature and it
                  also serves as a meeting place for the local community.
                  Forests the size of tennis courts A film for BBC People
                  Fixing the World by Richard Kenny and Anna Holligan. Why did
                  IVN start planting Tiny Forests? IVN's mission is to
                  re-connect people and nature by letting people experience the
                  true beauty of nature, preferably in their own neighbourhood.
                  The Netherlands is one of the most densely populated
                  countries in the world. About 66\% of the population lives in
                  an urban area, far away from nature. As a result, thousands
                  of kids never visit nature. How can we expect people - and
                  especially children - who never visit nature, to care about
                  nature, loss of biodiversity, climate change and plastic
                  soup? This is why we adopted the Tiny Forest initiative from
                  Shubhendu Sharma. It helps local communities and
                  schoolchildren to create a litte pockets of nature closeby.
                  This way they can visit and enjoy nature everyday, even in
                  heavily urbanized areas. Growing healthy and resilient
                  communities Tiny Forest is not just about restoring nature:
                  it is about creating a healthy environment, where people can
                  (re)connect to nature. With Tiny Forests, we want to create a
                  natural habitat for people in the city. Research shows that
                  children who spent a lot of time in nature, grow up to be
                  healthy, happy and creative adults, that want to contribute
                  to society. Illustration by Daan Bleichrodt (c) Educating a
                  generation of nature restorerers We believe that kids who
                  plant their own forest, learn how to maintain it, and follow
                  nature lessons in the outdoor classroom, will grow up loving
                  nature and will help to restore our planet to it's former
                  glory. That is why we involve schoolchildren and the local

              understanding particulate matter (PM) deposition on GI, there has
              been little focus on identifying which leaf traits might maximise
              airborne PM removal. This paper examines existing literature to
              synthesize the state of knowledge on leaf traits most relevant to
              PM removal. We systematically reviewed measurement studies that
              evaluated particulate matter accumulated on leaves on street
              trees, shrubs green roofs, and green walls, for a variety of leaf
              traits. Our final selection included 62 papers, most from field
              studies and a handful from wind tunnel studies. The following
              were variously promoted as useful traits: coniferous needle
              leaves; small, rough and textured broadleaves; lanceolate and
              ovate shapes; waxy coatings, and high-density trichomes.
              Consideration of these leaf traits, many of which are also
              associated with drought tolerance, may help to maximise PM
              capture. Although effective leaf traits were identified, there is
              no strong or consistent evidence to identify which is the most
              influential leaf trait in capturing PM. The diversity in sampling
              methods, wide comparison groups and lack of background PM
              concentration measures in many studies limited our ability to
              synthesize results. We found that several ancillary factors
              contribute to variations in the accumulation of PM on leaves,
              thus cannot recommend that selection of urban planting species be
              based primarily on leaf traits. Further research into the

  abstract = "The growing population in cities is causing a deterioration of
              air quality due to the emission of pollutants, causing serious
              health impacts. Trees and urban forests can contribute through
              the interception and removal of air pollutants such as
              particulate matter (PM). The dry deposition of PM by vegetation
              depends on air pollutant concentration, meteorological
              conditions, and specific leaf traits. Several studies explored
              the ability of different plant species to accumulate PM on leaf
              structures leading to the development of models to quantify the
              PM removal. The i-Tree Eco is the most used model to evaluate
              ecosystem services provided by urban trees. However, fine
              particulate matter (PM2.5) removal is still calculated with a
              poorly evaluated function of deposition velocity (which depends
              on wind speed and leaf area) without differentiating between tree
              species. Therefore, we present an improvement of the standard
              model calculation introducing a leaf trait index to distinguish
              the species effect on PM net removal. We also compared model
              results with measurements of deposited leaf PM by vacuum
              filtration. The index includes the effect of morphological and
              functional leaf characteristics of tree species using four
              parameters: leaf water storage, deposition velocity, resuspension
              rate and leaf washing capacity. Leaves of 11 common urban tree
              species were sampled in representative areas of the city of
              Ferrara (Italy) and at different times of the year from 2018 to
              2021. This includes four deciduous broadleaf trees (Tilia
              cordata, Platanus acerifolia, Acer platanoides, Celtis
              australis), three evergreen broadleaf trees (Quercus ilex,
              Magnolia grandiflora, Nerium oleander), and four conifers (Thuja
              orientalis, Cedrus libani, Pinus pinaster, Picea abies). The

              complete-case sample of the three cohorts from Norway and the
              United Kingdom (N = 355,732), 21,081 incident all CVD cases
              including 5259 ischemic heart disease (IHD) and 2871
              cerebrovascular cases were ascertained between baseline
              (1993-2010) and end of follow-up (2008-2013) through medical
              record linkage. Annual mean 24-hour weighted road traffic noise
              (Lden) and air pollution (particulate matter with aerodynamic
              diameter $\leq$ 10 $\mu$m [PM10], $\leq$2.5 $\mu$m [PM2.5] and
              nitrogen dioxide [NO2]) exposure at baseline address was modelled
              using a simplified version of the Common Noise Assessment Methods
              in Europe (CNOSSOS-EU) and European-wide Land Use Regression
              models. Individual-level covariate data were harmonised and
              physically pooled across the three cohorts. Analysis was via Cox
              proportional hazard model with mutual adjustments for both noise
              and air pollution and potential confounders. RESULTS: No
              significant associations were found between annual mean Lden and
              incident CVD, IHD or cerebrovascular disease in the overall
              population except that the association with incident IHD was
              significant among current-smokers. In the fully adjusted models
              including adjustment for Lden, an interquartile range (IQR)
              higher PM10 (4.1 $\mu$g/m3) or PM2.5 (1.4 $\mu$g/m3) was
              associated with a 5.8\% (95\%CI: 2.5\%-9.3\%) and 3.7\% (95\%CI:

              NO2 were associated with multimorbidity status in a
              dose-dependent manner. These associations were strongest when we
              compared the highest air pollution quartile (quartile 4: Q4) with
              the lowest quartile (Q1) [PM2.5: adjusted odds ratio (adjOR) =
              1.21 (95\% CI = 1.18, 1.24); NO2: adjOR = 1.19 (95 \% CI = 1.16,
              1.23)]. We also observed dose-response associations between air
              pollutant exposures and multimorbidity severity scores. We
              identified 11 multimorbidity patterns. Air pollution was
              associated with several multimorbidity patterns with strongest
              associations (Q4 vs. Q1) observed for neurological (stroke,
              epilepsy, alcohol/substance dependency) [PM2.5: adjOR = 1.31
              (95\% CI = 1.14, 1.51); NO2: adjOR = 1.33 (95\% CI = 1.11, 1.60)]
              and respiratory patterns (COPD, asthma) [PM2.5: adjOR = 1.24
              (95\% CI = 1.16, 1.33); NO2: adjOR = 1.26 (95\% CI = 1.15,
              1.38)]. CONCLUSIONS: This cross-sectional study provides evidence
              that exposure to air pollution might be associated with having
              multimorbid, multi-organ conditions. Longitudinal studies are
              needed to further explore these associations.",

               multi‐species, multi‐state, and multi‐season data, as well as
               support for fitting models with random effects. For

              innovative reforestation approach in Japan with the challenge to
              restore indigenous ecosystems, and maintaining global
              environments, including disaster prevention and carbon dioxide
              (CO2) mitigation. Here, natural vegetation successional stages
              (from bare soil to mature forest) are practically forced and
              reproduced, accelerating natural successional times. The Miyawaki
              method has been applied in the Far East, Malaysia, and South
              America; results have been very impressive, allowing quick
              environmental restorations of strongly degraded areas. However,
              these applications have always been made on sites characterized
              by high precipitation. The same method has never been used in a
              Mediterranean context distinguished by summer aridity and risk of
              desertification. A first test was carried out by the University
              of Tuscia, Department of Forest and Environment (DAF), 11 years
              ago in Sardinia (Italy) on an area where traditional
              reforestation methods had failed. For an appropriate Miyawaki
              application on this site, the original method was modified while
              maintaining its theoretical principles. Results obtained 2 and 11
              years after planting are positive: having compared the
              traditional reforestation techniques, plant biodiversity using
              the Miyawaki method appears very high, and the new coenosis
              (plant community) was able to evolve without further operative
              support after planting. Therefore, the implementation of
              supplementary technique along with cost reduction might provide a

                  forests. Every Tiny Forest is adopted by a local school, who
                  use the forest as an outdoor classroom. Scientist from
                  Wageningen University and Research (WENR) and citizen

                  maintain their own forest. Children are the Tiny Forest

                  a feel-good story, we also have numbers to back up our story.
                  We monitor the number of Tiny Forests we plant and the number
                  of people we engage. And scientists from Wageningen

                  and water retention. How many Tiny Forests have we planted?
                  In December 2015 we planted our first Tiny Forest of the
                  Netherlands in Darwinpark in Zaanstad. The program has been
                  running for 5 years now and is still expanding at a rapid
                  pace. In November 2020 we planted the 100th Tiny Forest and
                  we expect to plant our 200th forest in 2022. Check out all of
                  our forests in the map below. The map will be update

                  Research -- the Effect of Tiny Forest In February 2017
                  scientists from WENR started to monitor the effects of our
                  first Tiny Forest in the municipality of Zaanstad. This study
                  ran for a year. Thanks to the Dutch Postcode Lottery we were
                  able to start a four year research program in February 2018,
                  that is executed by the same scientists. In this study they
                  monitor the effect of eleven Tiny Forests on biodiversity,
                  CO2 sequestering, thermal comfort and water retention. The
                  scientists from WENR got help from 100 citizen scientist in
                  2019 and 2020, who assisted with the monitoring of the
                  biodiversity. What have we learned about the effects of Tiny
                  Forest so far? Effects biodiversity In 2017 scientist from
                  WENR discovered 176 different species of animals in the Tiny
                  Forest in Zaanstad. Download the full report In 2019 citizen
                  scientists trained by WENR discovered 595 different species
                  of animals and plants in seven different Tiny Forests. On the
                  1st of April 2021 WENR will present new data on the
                  biodiversity. We will update this page with the results. In
                  march 2022 the final report of the study will be published on
                  this website. CO2 sequestering In 2020 scientist from WENR
                  concluded that a standard sized Tiny Forest sequesters 127,5
                  kg of CO2 per year. They expect this to rise to 250 kg of CO2
                  per year as the forests grow older. Tiny Forest Zaanstad
                  (planted December 2015) sequestered 631 kg of CO2 in 2020.

               and thus the potential of urban roundabouts to support breeding

               an increase in caterpillar abundance and a greater number of

               species. An increase in the total number of trees was not
               correlated with a greater abundance of tree-feeding Lepidoptera;

               caterpillar species than all tree species, including introduced.
               This could be due to differences in species accumulation, the

  title    = "Biodiversity on urban roundabouts---Hemiptera, management and the
              species--area relationship",
  author   = "Helden, Alvin J and Leather, Simon R",
  abstract = "Summary The biodiversity of insects within urban areas has been
              relatively little studied. Given the large and ever increasing
              extent of urban areas, and that the insect species richness there
              can be high, it is important to know the factors determining that
              aspect of biodiversity. In this study two of these factors,
              namely habitat management and area, were considered. Arboreal and
              grassland Hemiptera, and grassland plants, were sampled on 18
              roundabouts and other road enclosed sites in the town of
              Bracknell. Hemiptera were sampled using suction sampling and tree
              beating. A significant species--area relationship was found for
              arboreal Hemiptera, which was strongly related to habitat
              diversity. For both grassland plants and Hemiptera, grassland
              management, by mowing, had a significant effect on species
              richness. Despite the management grassland plants showed a
              significant species--area relationship. However the effect of
              management on Hemiptera was great enough to outweigh any area
              effect. As the size of open spaces is often constrained in urban
              areas, altering habitat management has a greater potential for
              enhancing biodiversity. For arboreal Hemiptera choice of trees
              for planting is of particular importance, while for grassland
              Hemiptera diversity would be increased with a reduction in the
              intensity of management, such a reduction in the frequency of
              mowing. Zusammenfassung Die Biodiversit{\"a}t der Insekten auf
              urbanen Fl{\"a}chen ist relativ wenig untersucht. Angesichts der
              gro{\ss}en und der immer gr{\"o}{\ss}er werdenden Ausdehnung
              urbaner Gebiete und angesichts dessen, dass der Artenreichtum der
              Insekten dort gro{\ss} sein kann, ist es wichtig die Faktoren zu
              kennen, die diesen Aspekt der Biodiversit{\"a}t bestimmen. In
              dieser Untersuchung wurden zwei dieser Faktoren, n{\"a}mlich
              Habitatmanagement und Fl{\"a}che, betrachtet. Baum- und
              wiesenbewohnende Hemiptera sowie Wiesenpflanzen wurden in 18
              Kreisverkehren und anderen stra{\ss}enumschlossenen Orten
              innerhalb der Stadt Bracknell gesammelt. Die Hemiptera wurden mit
              Saugproben und Klopfproben an den B{\"a}umen gesammelt. F{\"u}r
              die baumbewohnenden Hemiptera wurde eine signifikante
              Art-Areal-Beziehung gefunden, die in enger Beziehung zur
              Habitatdiversit{\"a}t stand. Sowohl f{\"u}r die Wiesenpflanzen
              als auch f{\"u}r die Hemiptera hatte das Wiesenmanagement in Form
              von Mahd einen signifikanten Einfluss auf den Artenreichtum.
              Trotz des Managements zeigten die Wiesenpflanzen eine
              signifikante Art-Areal-Beziehung. Die Auswirkungen des
              Managements auf die Hemiptera waren jedoch gro{\ss} genug, um den
              Arealeffekt zu {\"u}berwiegen. Da die Gr{\"o}{\ss}e offener
              Fl{\"a}chen in st{\"a}dtischen Gebieten oft beschr{\"a}nkt ist,
              hat die {\"A}nderung des Habitatmanagements ein gr{\"o}{\ss}eres
              Potenzial die Biodiversit{\"a}t zu erh{\"o}hen. F{\"u}r
              baumbewohnende Hemiptera ist die Auswahl der B{\"a}ume f{\"u}r
              die Bepflanzung von besonderer Wichtigkeit, w{\"a}hrend f{\"u}r

              was 2x that in the coarsest data. Finer spatial resolution also
              allowed small, fragmented patches of woodland and grassland to be
              identified. ES provision (crop yield, carbon storage and
              pollinator abundance) was estimated from each map using the
              Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST)
              model. The finest resolution map resulted in 21\% lower predicted
              wheat production (due to lower estimates of cultivated land
              cover), 7\% higher predicted carbon stocks and 43\% higher
              predicted wild bee abundance compared to the coarsest resolution
              map. The estimated monetary value of ES provision increased by
              23.2\% between the 10 and 100 m dataset. We recommend that a LULC
              resolution of at least 10 m should be employed in agricultural
              landscapes to accurately capture ES provision. This can be
              achieved using GEE and could be used as a basis for the
              development of future natural capital policy.",

  abstract  = "Abstract Accurate and up-to-date land cover maps are vital for
               underpinning evidence-based landscape management
               decision-making. However, the technical skills required to
               extract tailored information about land cover dynamics from
               these open-access geospatial data often limit their use by those
               making landscape management decisions. Using Dartmoor National
               Park as an example, we demonstrate an open-source toolkit which
               uses open-source software (QGIS and RStudio) to process freely
               available Sentinel-2 and public LiDAR data sets to produce fine
               scale (10 m2 grain size) land cover maps. The toolbox has been
               designed for use by staff within the national park, for example,
               enabling land cover maps to be updated as required in the
               future. An area of 945 km2 was mapped using a trained random
               forest classifier following a classification scheme tailored to
               the needs of the national park. A 2019 land cover map had an
               overall user's accuracy of 79\%, with 13 out of 17 land cover
               classes achieving greater than 70\% accuracy. Spatially,
               accuracy was related via logistical regression to blue band
               surface reflectance in the spring and topographic slope derived
               from LiDAR (1 m resolution), with greater accuracy in steeper
               terrain and areas exhibiting higher blue reflectance. Between an
               earlier (2017?2019) and later (2019?2021) time frame, 8\% of
               pixels changed, most of the change by area occurred in the most
               common classes. However, the largest proportional increase
               occurred in Upland Meadows, Lowland Meadows and Blanket Bog, all
               habitats subject to restoration efforts. Identifying areas of
               change enables future field work to be better targeted. We
               discuss the application of this mapping to land management
               within the Dartmoor national park and of the potential of
               tailored land cover and land cover change mapping, via this

               difficulties of acquiring relevant data about their character,
               extent, and location. We present a model which uses national
               datasets to describe the distribution of woody linear features
               along boundaries in Great Britain. The method can be applied for
               other boundary types and in other locations around the world
               across a range of spatial scales where different types of linear
               feature can be separated using characteristics such as height or
               width. Satellite-derived Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) provided
               the spatial framework for locating linear features and was used
               to screen out areas unsuitable for their occurrence, that is,
               offshore, urban, and forest areas. Similarly, Ordnance Survey
               Land-Form PANORAMA\textregistered{}, a digital terrain model,
               was used to screen out where they do not occur. The presence of
               woody linear features on boundaries was modelled using
               attributes from a canopy height dataset obtained by subtracting
               a digital terrain map (DTM) from a digital surface model (DSM).
               The performance of the model was evaluated against existing
               woody linear feature data in Countryside Survey across a range
               of scales. The results indicate that, despite some
               underestimation, this simple approach may provide valuable

               Tree genera were either used as independent data points or to
               calculate phylogenetically independent contrasts. For the latter
               approach, a phylogeny for the tree genera was generated from
               published rbcL gene sequences. In general, the conclusions from
               the two types of analyses were similar. 3 ?The species richness
               of phytophages on German tree genera were positively related to

               complexity of the host's morphology. SUMMARY (1) The number of
               species of Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, Homoptera and Diptera
               feeding on British Rosaceae generally increases with the size of
               the geographic range of the host species, and with the
               complexity of the host's morphology. (2) Within the Rosaceae,
               trees support more insect species than shrubs which in turn
               support more insect species than herbs. In addition, trees have
               more insect species within each insect guild and taxonomic
               grouping associated with them than shrubs, which in turn have
               more than herbs. (3) Although shrubs and herbs begin to
               accumulate insect species at a lower level of abundance than
               trees, trees accrue species at almost twice the rate of herbs
               and shrubs. The species-accrual rate for different guilds of
               insects (chewing, sucking and gall-forming) and for the four
               taxa of insects considered (Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera
               and Homoptera) is greatest on trees except in the case of
               gall-forming insects and Diptera, where the rate is similar for
               trees, shrubs and herbs. (4) The older the plant's history of
               establishment, based on the number of Quaternary records, the
               more insect species that are associated with it. Also, more
               recent less widespread plants have a greater polyphagous insect
               fauna than older more widespread plants. (5) Various analyses
               enabled 83\%, 83\% and 45\% of the variation in insect species
               richness between trees, shrubs and herbs to be accounted for,
               respectively. The low variation accounted for in the case of the
               herbs may be the result of the poor quality of insect records
               for this group of plants. (6) Within given genera of plants,
               increases in geographical range and plant complexity are
               associated with an increase in the number of insects feeding
               upon them. When each genus within the Rosaceae was considered as
               a separate entity a similar pattern was seen. (7) Of the six
               plant genera with at least three members (Prunus, Sorbus, Rubus,

               co-ordinates analysis. The relationships between the plant

               groups were woody plants (trees and shrubs), aquatic plants and
               herbs. A wet to dry gradient was distinguished, as were
               evergreen plants, and early successional plant families with
               weeds and annuals. Taxonomically, plant families of the same
               order were closer together if they were predominantly of the
               same life form. Fagales and several orders of monocotyledons

  abstract  = "The number of herbivore species on British trees was shown to be
               positively related to the trees' cumulative ancient abundance
               (based on pollen records) was that of Southwood (1961), and this
               regression relationship was significant (P < .001) and 72\% of
               the variation was explained by the independent variable. The
               wide variation in the number of species of insect herbivores
               associated with different plant species has been shown to be a
               result of, among other things, the following: the plant's
               cumulative ancient abundance (Southwood 1961); its geographical
               range (Strong 1974; Levin 1976; Lawton and Schrdder 1977); the
               length of time that the plant has been available for
               colonization (Birks 1980); its taxonomic isolation (Lawton and
               Schrdder 1977); successional status (Cates and Orians 1975);
               growth form (Maiorana 1978; Scriber 1978); and structural
               complexity (Price 1977; Lawton and Price 1979). Plant attributes
               such as cumulative ancient abundance, successional status,
               geographical range, etc., may be regarded as components of
               ``apparency'' as defined by Feeny (1976). Plants which are
               apparent in time, space, or some other way would, by definition,
               be more vulnerable to insect attack than would unapparent
               plants. They would be expected to be the hosts of a larger
               number of herbivores since more evolutionary encounters between
               potential grazers and the plant will have occurred, increasing
               the frequency with which the plant's chemical and physical
               defenses will be overcome by initially naive herbivores. A
               seminal paper in which the number of herbivore species on
               British trees was shown to be positively related to the trees'
               cumulative ancient abundance (based on pollen records) was that
               of Southwood (1961). This regression relationship was
               significant (P < .001) and 72\% of the variation was explained
               by the independent variable. Factors invoked by Southwood as
               possible contributors to the residual variation, but by
               implication, not to the trend itself, were: taxonomic isolation,
               current abundance, and inherent differences in palatability
               between the trees, a tree with a higher than expected herbivore
               complement possibly being of high palatability. In this
               communication we examine the latter possibility. To test it,
               wholly green leaves from the following pairs of tree species
               were collected in mid-October 1979 and in June-July 1980: oak
               (Quercus robur)/birch (Betula pubescens); hawthorn (Crataegus
               nmonogyna )l sh (Fraxinus excelsior-); willow (Salix cinerea
               hazell (Coiylus avellana); apple (Malus sylvestris)lmountain ash
               (Sorbus aucuparia); apple (Malus sylvestris)/lime (Tilia x
               vulgaris). The species in a pair were selected because of their
               very similar cumulative ancient abundances according to Godwin's
               (1975) data, but very dissimilar numbers of herbivore species
               they supported. The first-mentioned species in each pair always
               bore more herbivores than expected while the second fell on or
               below Southwood's regression line. In the spring and autumn
               experiments, for each species pair, six discs (12 mm diameter)
               of each of the two species were cut with a cork borer and placed
               alternately in a grid on damp soil (John Innes compost no. 2) in
               closed polystyrene boxes measuring 17 x 11 x 6 cm. One
               individual of the snail Helix asperse, which had been starved
               for 24 h, was taken from a uniformly sized collection and placed
               in each box. Snails were chosen for this bioassay because they
               may be regarded as general",

              decadal population cycles, and browsing from abundant caribou
              could be expected to counteract the current climate-driven
              expansion of shrubs in the circumpolar tundra biome. We
              demonstrate that the sea ice cover in the Arctic Ocean has
              provided a strong signal for climate-induced changes on the
              adjacent caribou summer ranges, outperforming other climate
              indices in explaining the caribou-plant dynamics. We found no
              evidence of a negative effect of caribou abundance on vegetation

               decline has the potential to influence ecological dynamics in

               is limited, however, particularly at the local population and
               community levels. Here we identify an Arctic sea ice signal in
               the annual timing of vegetation emergence at an inland tundra
               system in West Greenland. According to the time series analyses
               presented here, an ongoing advance in plant phenology at this
               site is attributable to the accelerating decline in Arctic sea
               ice, and contributes to declining large herbivore reproductive
               performance via trophic mismatch. Arctic-wide sea ice metrics
               consistently outperform other regional and local abiotic
               variables in models characterizing these dynamics, implicating

               on land. The effect of lower Arctic sea ice levels on local

              nature of precipitation events are also predicted to change in
              the future. These changes in climate are expected, together with
              increasing human pressures, to have significant impacts on Arctic
              and sub-Arctic species and ecosystems. Due to the key role that
              reindeer play in those ecosystems, it is essential to understand
              how climate will affect the region's most important species. Our
              study assesses the role of climate on the dynamics of fourteen
              Eurasian reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) populations, using for the
              first time data on reindeer abundance collected over a 70-year
              period, including both wild and semi-domesticated reindeer, and
              covering more than half of the species' total range. We analyzed
              trends in population dynamics, investigated synchrony among
              population growth rates, and assessed the effects of climate on
              population growth rates. Trends in the population dynamics were
              remarkably heterogeneous. Synchrony was apparent only among some
              populations and was not correlated with distance among population
              ranges. Proxies of climate variability mostly failed to explain
              population growth rates and synchrony. For both wild and
              semi-domesticated populations, local weather, biotic pressures,
              loss of habitat and human disturbances appear to have been more
              important drivers of reindeer population dynamics than climate.
              In semi-domesticated populations, management strategies may have
              masked the effects of climate. Conservation efforts should aim to
              mitigate human disturbances, which could exacerbate the
              potentially negative effects of climate change on reindeer
              populations in the future. Special protection and support should
              be granted to those semi-domesticated populations that suffered
              the most because of the collapse of the Soviet Union, in order to

  abstract = "The Arctic is undergoing rapid changes, with anthropogenic shifts
              in climate having important and well-documented impacts on
              habitat. Populations of predators and their prey are affected by
              changing climate and other anthropogenic factors, and these
              changing trophic interactions could have profound effects on
              breeding populations of Arctic birds. Variable abundance of
              lemmings (a primary prey of generalist Arctic predators) and
              increasing abundance of light geese (Lesser Snow and Ross' Geese;
              a secondary prey) could have negative consequences for numerous
              sympatric shorebirds (an incidental prey). Using 16 years of
              predator-prey observations and 13-years of shorebird nest
              survival data at a site near a goose colony we identify
              relationships among geese, lemmings, and their shared predators
              and then relate predator indices to shorebird risk of nest
              predation. During two years, we also placed time-lapse cameras
              and artificial shorebird nests at increasing distances from a
              goose colony to document spatial trends in predators and their
              effect on risk of predation. In the long-term data, yearly
              indices of light geese positively influenced indices of gulls and
              jaegers, and shorebird nest predation rate was negatively
              correlated with jaeger and fox indices. All three predator
              indices were highest near the goose colony and artificial nest
              predation probability was negatively correlated with distance
              from goose colony, but these effects were less apparent during
              the second year. Combined, these results highlight the variation
              in predator-mediated interactions between geese and shorebirds
              and outline one mechanism by which hyperabundant geese may be
              contributing to local or regional declines in Arctic-nesting
              shorebird populations.",

              important to understand ecosystem changes and to manage
              populations in the context of conservation or control. The arctic
              fox population in Iceland has increased steadily over a period of
              30 years, an increase that has been attributed to an overall
              increase in food abundance. We hypothesized that increasing
              populations of geese or seabirds were driving this growth. We
              analyzed stable isotopes in a long-term series of collagen
              samples to determine the role of these different resources. The
              isotopic signatures of arctic foxes differed consistently between
              coastal and inland habitats. While $\delta$15N displayed a
              non-linear change over time with a slight increase in the first
              part of the period followed by a decline in both habitats,
              $\delta$13C was stable. Stable isotope mixing models suggested
              that marine resources and rock ptarmigan were the most important
              dietary sources, with marine resources dominating in coastal
              habitats and rock ptarmigan being more important inland. Our
              results suggest that seabirds may have been driving the arctic
              fox population increase. The rapidly increasing populations of
              breeding geese seem to have played a minor role in arctic fox
              population growth, as rock ptarmigan was the most important
              terrestrial resource despite a considerable decrease in their
              abundance during recent decades. This study shows that a
              long-term population trend in a generalist predator may have
              occurred without a pronounced change in main dietary resources,
              despite ongoing structural changes in the food web, where one
              species of herbivorous birds increased and another decreased.",

              showed a qualitative relationship to variations in vegetation.
              However, there were significant differences among the VIs over
              desert, grassland, and forested biomes. The normalized difference
              vegetation index (NDVI) was sensitive to and responded primarily
              to the highly absorbing red reflectance band, while other indices
              such (is the soil and atmosphere resistant vegetation index
              (SARVI) were more responsive to variations in the near-infrared

               reveal patterns in how social media users interact with urban

               a year to the image-sharing application Instagram. Findings A
               third of all the images contained some elements of green nature,
               with 3.1\% of the images portraying urban trees as the main
               subject and 11\% with urban trees as background features.

               Accompanying text, in the form of hashtags and image
               descriptions, was mostly positive and showed how
               enthusiastically people describe urban nature. An assessment of
               the images in terms of CES revealed that beyond aesthetic
               factors and the inspiration to take photographs of nature, a
               wide range of CES are represented, reflecting the recognition of

               innovative solutions that address current climate and societal
               challenges in an urban context. Cities are often on the front
               lines of environmental change, meaning urban greening strategies
               have high potential to provide benefits across human
               communities, while protecting global biodiversity. There is
               growing consensus that nature-based solutions can provide
               multiple benefits to people and nature while also mitigating the
               effects of climate change. Urban forest management is
               well-suited to a nature-based solutions framework due to the
               wide variety of services trees provide our communities.
               Effective approaches to urban forest management also have the
               potential to promote other forms of urban biodiversity,
               particularly birds and species at risk. However, studies that
               integrate strategies for both climate and biodiversity
               conservation are rare. The goal of this systematic map is to
               gather and describe information on two desired outcomes of urban
               forest management: (1) conserving avian diversity and species at
               risk (2) carbon storage and sequestration (i.e., nature-based
               climate solutions). Methods We will identify relevant articles
               from two separate searches for inclusion in our systematic map
               that address (1) urban forestry and avian and species at risk
               conservation and, (2) urban forestry and carbon storage and
               sequestration. We will search two bibliographic databases,
               consult 20 relevant organizational websites, and solicit grey
               literature through an open call for evidence. Eligibility
               screening will be conducted at two stages: (1) title and
               abstract and (2) full text. Relevant information from included
               papers will be extracted and entered in a searchable, coded

               characteristics of each study (e.g., geographic locations,
               interventions, outcomes, species studied) and identify knowledge

               forests is governed by the UK Forestry Standard (UKFS),
               self-certified as the ? ? reference standard for sustainable
               forest management in the UK?. However, the urban forest has no
               comparable national standard. With an increasing need to manage
               urban trees sustainably, a fit-for-purpose approach is required
               to promote sustainable, consistent and efficient urban tree

               management is not cohesive and not related to any standard.
               Conversely, the principles of high forest silvicultural
               management are well publicised and adopted. Within forest

               Continuous Cover Forestry (CCF). CCF is not a system, but
               instead, an approach used to attain set objectives (such as
               biodiversity and timber production). This research has shown a
               CCF approach can be directly applied to the urban forest.

              surface vegetation system, and is also a key parameter for the
              models of global water balancing and carbon circulation. By using
              the reflectance values of Landsat-5 blue, green and red channels
              simulated from rice reflectance spectrum, the sensitivities of
              the bands to LAI were analyzed, and the response and capability
              to estimate LAI of various NDVIs (normalized difference
              vegetation indices), which were established by substituting the
              red band of general NDVI with all possible combinations of red,
              green and blue bands, were assessed. Finally, the conclusion was
              tested by rice data at different conditions. The sensitivities of
              red, green and blue bands to LAI were different under various
              conditions. When LAI was less than 3, red and blue bands were
              more sensitive to LAI. Though green band in the circumstances was
              less sensitive to LAI than red and blue bands, it was sensitive
              to LAI in a wider range. When the vegetation indices were
              constituted by all kinds of combinations of red, green and blue
              bands, the premise for making the sensitivity of these vegetation
              indices to LAI be meaningful was that the value of one of the
              combinations was greater than 0.024, i.e. visible reflectance
              (VIS)>0.024. Otherwise, the vegetation indices would be
              saturated, resulting in lower estimation accuracy of LAI.
              Comparison on the capabilities of the vegetation indices derived
              from all kinds of combinations of red, green and blue bands to
              LAI estimation showed that GNDVI (Green NDVI) and GBNDVI
              (Green-Blue NDVI) had the best relations with LAI. The
              capabilities of GNDVI and GBNDVI to LAI estimation were tested
              under different circumstances, and the same result was acquired.
              It suggested that GNDVI and GBNDVI performed better to predict

              potential for extensive data to define species occurrence and

              validate these richness patterns and ensure these data are

              citizen science project---FrogID---with expert-derived range maps

              in space. We then investigated how many citizen science

              from an expert-derived map of frog distributions. An average of
              153 citizen science submissions were necessary to fully-sample
              frog richness based on the expert-derived frog richness. Sampling
              effort in the citizen science project was negatively correlated

              richness at a continental scale compared with an expert-derived

              resource exploitation for predators and their prey. Alterations
              of these pathways could be especially intense in ecosystems
              characterized by a simple trophic structure and rapid warming
              trends, such as in the Arctic. However, quantifying the multiple
              direct and indirect pathways through which climate change is

              causal mechanisms driven by climate affecting predator-prey
              interactions of species sharing a tundra food web. We based our
              study on relationships between one Arctic predator (Arctic fox)
              and its two main prey - lemmings (preferred prey) and snow geese
              (alternate prey) - which are exposed to variable local and
              regional climatic factors across years. We used a combination of
              models mapping multiple causal links among key variables derived
              from a long-term dataset (21 years). We obtained several possible
              scenarios linking regional climate factors (Arctic oscillations)
              and local temperature and precipitation to the breeding of
              species. Our results suggest that both regional and local climate
              factors have direct and indirect impacts on the breeding of foxes
              and geese. Local climate showed a positive causal link with goose
              nesting success, while both regional and local climate displayed
              contrasted effects on the proportion of fox breeding. We found no
              impact of climate on lemming abundance. We observed positive
              relationships between lemming, fox and goose reproduction
              highlighting numerical and functional responses of fox to the
              variability of lemming abundance. Our study measures causal links
              and strength of interactions in a food web, quantifying both
              numerical response of a predator and apparent interactions
              between its two main prey. These results improve our

               lemming density were associated with nesting success of greater
               snow geese (Anser caerulescens atlanticus) in the Canadian High
               Arctic. We tested predictions of the APH and NAH for geese
               breeding at low and high densities. Goose nesting success varied
               from 22\% to 91\% between years and the main egg predator was
               the arctic fox (Alopex lagopus). Nesting associations with snowy
               owls (Nyctea scandiaca) were observed but only during peak
               lemming years for geese nesting at low density. Goose nesting
               success declined as distance from owls increased and reached a
               plateau at 550 m. Artificial nest experiments indicated that
               owls can exclude predators from the vicinity of their nests and
               thus reduce goose egg predation rate. Annual nest failure rate
               was negatively associated with rodent abundance and was
               generally highest in low lemming years. This relationship was
               present even after excluding goose nests under the protective
               influence of owls. However, nest failure was inversely
               density-dependent at high breeding density. Thus, annual
               variations in nest density influenced the synchrony between
               lemming cycles and oscillations in nesting success. Our results
               suggest that APH is the main mechanism linking lemming cycles
               and goose nesting success and that nesting associations during
               peak lemming years (NAH) can enhance this positive link at the
               local level. The study also shows that breeding strategies used
               by birds (the alternative prey) could affect the synchrony
               between oscillations in avian reproductive success and rodent
               cycles.]",

  abstract = "The huge changes in population sizes of Arctic-nesting geese
              offer a great opportunity to study population limitation in
              migratory animals. In geese, population limitation seems to have
              shifted from wintering to summering grounds. There, in the
              Arctic, climate is rapidly changing, and this may impact
              reproductive performance, and perhaps population size of geese,
              both directly (e.g. by changes in snow melt) or indirectly (e.g.
              by changes in trophic interactions). Dark-bellied brent geese
              (Branta bernicla bernicla L.) increased 20-fold since the 1950s.
              Its reproduction fluctuates strongly in concert with the 3-year
              lemming cycle. An earlier analysis, covering the growth period
              until 1988, did not find evidence for density dependence, but
              thereafter the population levelled off and even decreased. The
              question is whether this is caused by changes in lemming cycles,
              population density or other factors like carry-over effects.
              Breeding success was derived from proportions of juveniles. We
              used an information-theoretical approach to investigate which
              environmental factors best explained the variation in breeding
              success over nearly 50 years (1960-2008). We subsequently
              combined GLM predictions of breeding success with published
              survival estimates to project the population trajectory since
              1991 (year of maximum population size). In this way, we separated
              the effects of lemming abundance and population density on
              population development. Breeding success was mainly dependent on
              lemming abundance, the onset of spring at the breeding grounds,
              and the population size of brent goose. No evidence was found for
              carry-over effects (i.e. effects of conditions at main spring
              staging site). Negative density dependence was operating at a
              population size above c. 200 000 individuals, but the levelling
              off of the population could be explained by faltering lemming
              cycles alone. Lemmings have long been known to affect population
              productivity of Arctic-nesting migratory birds and, more
              recently, possibly population dynamics of resident bird species,
              but this is the first evidence for effects of lemming abundance
              on population size of a migratory bird species. Why lemming
              cycles are faltering in the last two decades is unclear, but this
              may be associated with changes in winter climate at Taimyr
              Peninsula (Siberia).",

              The insect food supply for waders showed similar patterns of

               diffusion through trophic levels is poorly known because of a
               lack of individual-based studies. Our objective was to examine
               how the hoarding behaviour of arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus)
               preying on a seasonal pulsed resource (goose eggs) was affected
               by annual and seasonal changes in resource availability. We
               monitored foraging behaviour of foxes in a greater snow goose
               (Chen caerulescens atlanticus) colony during 8 nesting seasons
               that covered 2 lemming cycles. The number of goose eggs taken
               and cached per hour by foxes declined 6-fold from laying to
               hatching, while the proportion of eggs cached remained constant.
               In contrast, the proportion of eggs cached by foxes fluctuated
               in response to the annual lemming cycle independently of the
               seasonal pulse of goose eggs. Foxes cached the majority of eggs
               taken (> 90\%) when lemming abundance was high or moderate but
               only 40\% during the low phase of the cycle. This likely
               occurred because foxes consumed a greater proportion of goose
               eggs to fulfill their energy requirement at low lemming
               abundance. Our study clearly illustrates a behavioural mechanism
               that extends the energetic benefits of a resource pulse. The
               hoarding behaviour of the main predator enhances the

               the south into the arctic terrestrial ecosystem. This could

               1 We investigated the hypothesis that cyclic lemming populations
               indirectly affect arctic-nesting greater snow geese (Anser
               caerulescens atlanticus L.) through the behavioural and
               numerical responses of shared predators. 2 The study took place
               on Bylot Island in the Canadian High Arctic during two lemming
               cycles. We recorded changes in foraging behaviour and activity
               rate of arctic foxes, parasitic jaegers, glaucous gulls and
               common ravens in a goose colony during one lemming cycle and we
               monitored denning activity of foxes for 7 years. We also
               evaluated the total response of predators (i.e. number of eggs
               depredated). 3 Arctic foxes were more successful in attacking
               lemmings than goose nests because predators were constrained by
               goose nest defence. Predators increased their foraging effort on
               goose eggs following a lemming decline. 4 Activity rates in the
               goose colony varied 3·5-fold in arctic foxes and 4·8-fold in
               parasitic jaegers, and were highest 2 and 3 years after the
               lemming peak, respectively. The breeding output of arctic foxes
               appeared to be driven primarily by lemming numbers. 5 Predators
               consumed 19--88\% of the annual goose nesting production and egg
               predation intensity varied 2·7-fold, being lowest during peak
               lemming years. Arctic foxes and parasitic jaegers were the key
               predators generating marked annual variation in egg predation. 6
               Our study provides strong support for short-term, positive
               indirect effects and long-term, negative indirect effects of
               lemming populations on arctic-nesting geese. The outcome between

  abstract = "The bird--lemming hypothesis postulates that breeding success of
              tundra-nesting geese and waders in Siberia follows the cyclic
              pattern of lemming populations, as a result of predators
              switching from lemmings to birds when the lemming population
              crashes. We present 50 years of data on constant-effort catches
              of red knot Calidris canutus and curlew sandpiper C. ferruginea
              at an autumn migratory stopover site (Ottenby) at the Baltic Sea,
              supplemented with literature data on winter censuses of
              dark-bellied brent goose Branta b. bernicla and white-fronted
              goose Anser albifrons in northwestern Europe, and waders in
              Germany and Southern Africa. Number and proportion of juveniles
              in these bird populations (both our own and literature data) were
              compared with an index of predation pressure (calculated from the
              abundance of lemmings on the Taimyr peninsula), and climate
              indices for the North Eurasia and the North Atlantic regions. The
              index of predation pressure correlated significantly with the
              number of juveniles of red knot and curlew sandpiper, but not
              with number of adults. Also, this index correlated with the
              reproductive performance of geese and waders reported in the
              literature. Fourier analysis revealed a significant deviation
              from random noise with the maximum spectral density at the period
              length of 3 years for number of juvenile red knots and curlew
              sandpipers captured at Ottenby, abundance of lemmings,
              reproduction in arctic fox Alopex lagopus, and reproductive
              performance in geese on the Siberian tundra. Also, the date of
              passage at Ottenby for adult red knot and curlew sandpiper showed
              a spectral density peak at a period length of 3 years, the latter
              species also showing a peak at a period length of 5--6 years.
              Passage dates for adult red knot and curlew sandpiper were
              earlier in years of high predation pressure compared with years
              of low predation pressure. The fluctuations in reproductive
              success of the studied Siberian goose and wader species appear to
              be primarily influenced by biotic factors in the breeding area,
              rather than by abiotic factors, such as climate oscillations.
              Annual variations in migratory arctic bird populations may have
              far reaching effects in habitats along their migration routes and
              in their wintering areas. We suggest a link between lemming
              cyclicity in the Northern Hemisphere and predation pressure on
              Southern Hemisphere benthos, in which the signal is carried
              between continents by long distance migrating waders.",

              environmental changes is difficult because the relative
              importance of top-down vs. bottom-up forces in controlling
              ecosystems is still debated. This is especially true in the
              Arctic tundra where, despite relatively simple food webs, it is
              still unclear which forces dominate in this ecosystem. Our
              primary goal was to assess the extent to which a tundra food web
              was dominated by plant-herbivore or predator-prey interactions.
              Based on a 17-year (1993-2009) study of terrestrial wildlife on
              Bylot Island, Nunavut, Canada, we developed trophic mass balance
              models to address this question. Snow Geese were the dominant
              herbivores in this ecosystem, followed by two sympatric lemming
              species (brown and collared lemmings). Arctic foxes, weasels, and
              several species of birds of prey were the dominant predators.
              Results of our trophic models encompassing 19 functional groups
              showed that <10\% of the annual primary production was consumed
              by herbivores in most years despite the presence of a large Snow
              Goose colony, but that 20-100\% of the annual herbivore
              production was consumed by predators. The impact of herbivores on
              vegetation has also weakened over time, probably due to an
              increase in primary production. The impact of predators was
              highest on lemmings, intermediate on passerines, and lowest on
              geese and shorebirds, but it varied with lemming abundance.
              Predation of collared lemmings exceeded production in most years
              and may explain why this species remained at low density. In
              contrast, the predation rate on brown lemmings varied with prey
              density and may have contributed to the high-amplitude, periodic
              fluctuations in the abundance of this species. Our analysis
              provided little evidence that herbivores are limited by primary
              production on Bylot Island. In contrast, we measured strong
              predator-prey interactions, which supports the hypothesis that
              this food web is primarily controlled by top-down forces. The
              presence of allochthonous resources subsidizing top predators and
              the absence of large herbivores may partly explain the
              predominant role of predation in this low-productivity ecosystem.",

               systems and that exchanges of resources across ecosystem
               boundaries can have repercussions on food webs, especially in
               low productivity systems such as the terrestrial Arctic.
               However, because these exchanges can take multiple forms,
               assessing their significance in the functioning of the tundra
               food web is difficult. In this paper, we first review some
               important concepts related to resource exchanges between
               ecosystems and examine their relevance to the study of trophic
               interactions in the arctic tundra. An analysis of the Bylot
               Island food web in the Canadian Arctic using a mass-balance
               trophic model suggests that predators are the dominant force
               controlling this food web. However, an important feature of this
               ecosystem is that several top predators benefit from
               allochthonous inputs, either through the presence of migratory
               birds during the summer or the use of the marine environment as
               a foraging ground in winter. We also show that migratory birds
               may act as autochthonous resource exporters for lower trophic
               levels, for instance by removing nitrogen from the nutrient pool
               when young produced locally migrate south and die away from the
               system. Although these resource exchanges may be a general
               feature of several arctic terrestrial ecosystems, their
               importance in the functioning of the tundra food web remains to
               be determined. Through long-term monitoring, we found that
               primary production in wetlands of Bylot Island increased by 85\%
               over a 20-y period, likely a consequence of the warming trend
               observed in the area. However, we have not detected any changes
               at higher trophic levels, which is consistent with a top-down
               control of this food web. Given the importance of resource
               exchanges between ecosystems in the dynamics of the tundra food
               web, a full investigation of the effects of climate change will
               require a broader cross-ecosystem perspective.",

              combines a customized hierarchical urban habitat classification
              scheme with citizen science-generated species occurrence data,
              such as iNaturalist and eBird. It integrates publicly available

              occurrence information and serves as a novel method for
              conducting urban biodiversity assessments. This framework
              provides insights into how species occurrences within an urban
              landscape are associated with spatial variation in the physical
              and anthropogenic environment. It can also yield information

              maintaining and enhancing the abundance and diversity of native

              employ it, and it can be implemented in urban areas worldwide,
              wherever adequate data exist. We demonstrate the application of
              this framework in the highly urbanized portion of Los Angeles
              County, California, USA. Our demonstration used 18 physical and
              anthropogenic variables to classify our study area into nine

              urban habitat types with species occurrences using research-grade

              differences in distributions of some species between these nine
              urban habitat types and demonstrated that the proposed framework
              can be used to conduct urban biodiversity assessments. With
              increasing availability of remote sensing data and

               estimating demographic parameters of animal populations, has
               been applied to human populations. This tutorial reviews various
               closed capture-recapture models which are applicable to
               ascertainment data for estimating the size of a target
               population based on several incomplete lists of individuals.
               Most epidemiological approaches merging different lists and
               eliminating duplicate cases are likely to be biased downwards.
               That is, the final merged list misses those who are in the
               population but were not ascertained in any of the lists. If
               there are no matching errors, then the duplicate information
               collected from a capture-recapture experiment can be used to
               estimate the number of missed under proper assumptions. Three
               approaches and their associated estimation procedures are
               introduced: ecological models; log-linear models, and the sample
               coverage approach. Each approach has its unique way of
               incorporating two types of source dependencies: local (list)
               dependence and dependence due to heterogeneity. An interactive
               program, CARE (for capture-recapture) developed by the authors
               is demonstrated using four real data sets. One set of data deals
               with infection by the acute hepatitis A virus in an outbreak in
               Taiwan; the other three sets are ascertainment data on diabetes,
               spina bifida and infants' congenital anomaly discussed in the
               literature. These data sets provide examples to show the
               usefulness of the capture-recapture method in correcting for
               under-ascertainment. The limitations of the methodology and some
               cautionary remarks are also discussed.",

  abstract = "Estimating the species, phylogenetic, and functional diversity of
              a community is challenging because rare species are often
              undetected, even with intensive sampling. The Good-Turing
              frequency formula, originally developed for cryptography,
              estimates in an ecological context the true frequencies of rare
              species in a single assemblage based on an incomplete sample of
              individuals. Until now, this formula has never been used to
              estimate undetected species, phylogenetic, and functional
              diversity. Here, we first generalize the Good-Turing formula to
              incomplete sampling of two assemblages. The original formula and
              its two-assemblage generalization provide a novel and unified
              approach to notation, terminology, and estimation of undetected
              biological diversity. For species richness, the Good-Turing
              framework offers an intuitive way to derive the non-parametric
              estimators of the undetected species richness in a single
              assemblage, and of the undetected species shared between two
              assemblages. For phylogenetic diversity, the unified approach
              leads to an estimator of the undetected Faith's phylogenetic
              diversity (PD, the total length of undetected branches of a
              phylogenetic tree connecting all species), as well as a new
              estimator of undetected PD shared between two phylogenetic trees.
              For functional diversity based on species traits, the unified
              approach yields a new estimator of undetected Walker et al.'s
              functional attribute diversity (FAD, the total species-pairwise
              functional distance) in a single assemblage, as well as a new
              estimator of undetected FAD shared between two assemblages.
              Although some of the resulting estimators have been previously
              published (but derived with traditional mathematical
              inequalities), all taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional
              diversity estimators are now derived under the same framework.
              All the derived estimators are theoretically lower bounds of the
              corresponding undetected diversities; our approach reveals the
              sufficient conditions under which the estimators are nearly
              unbiased, thus offering new insights. Simulation results are
              reported to numerically verify the performance of the derived
              estimators. We illustrate all estimators and assess their
              sampling uncertainty with an empirical dataset for Brazilian rain
              forest trees. These estimators should be widely applicable to
              many current problems in ecology, such as the effects of climate
              change on spatial and temporal beta diversity and the
              contribution of trait diversity to ecosystem multi-functionality.",

  abstract  = "Quantifying and assessing changes in biological diversity are
               central aspects of many ecological studies, yet accurate methods
               of estimating biological diversity from sampling data have been
               elusive. Hill numbers, or the effective number of species, are
               increasingly used to characterize the taxonomic, phylogenetic,
               or functional diversity of an assemblage. However, empirical
               estimates of Hill numbers, including species richness, tend to
               be an increasing function of sampling effort and, thus, tend to
               increase with sample completeness. Integrated curves based on
               sampling theory that smoothly link rarefaction (interpolation)
               and prediction (extrapolation) standardize samples on the basis
               of sample size or sample completeness and facilitate the
               comparison of biodiversity data. Here we extended previous
               rarefaction and extrapolation models for species richness (Hill
               number q D, where q ¼ 0) to measures of taxon diversity
               incorporating relative abundance (i.e., for any Hill number q D,
               q . 0) and present a unified approach for both individual-based
               (abundance) data and sample- based (incidence) data. Using this
               unified sampling framework, we derive both theoretical formulas
               and analytic estimators for seamless rarefaction and
               extrapolation based on Hill numbers. Detailed examples are
               provided for the first three Hill numbers: q ¼ 0 (species
               richness), q ¼ 1 (the exponential of Shannon's entropy index),
               and q ¼ 2 (the inverse of Simpson's concentration index). We
               developed a bootstrap method for constructing confidence
               intervals around Hill numbers, facilitating the comparison of
               multiple assemblages of both rarefied and extrapolated samples.
               The proposed estimators are accurate for both rarefaction and
               short-range extrapolation. For long-range extrapolation, the
               performance of the estimators depends on both the value of q and
               on the extrapolation range. We tested our methods on simulated
               data generated from species abundance models and on data from
               large species inventories. We also illustrate the formulas and

              understanding of the patterns. During the past two decades,
              macroecologists have successfully addressed technical problems
              posed by spatial autocorrelation, intercorrelation of predictor
              variables and non-linearity. However, curve-fitting approaches
              are problematic because most theoretical models in macroecology
              do not make quantitative predictions, and they do not incorporate
              interactions among multiple forces. As an alternative, we propose
              a mechanistic modelling approach. We describe computer simulation
              models of the stochastic origin, spread, and extinction of
              species' geographical ranges in an environmentally heterogeneous,
              gridded domain and describe progress to date regarding their
              implementation. The output from such a general simulation model
              (GSM) would, at a minimum, consist of the simulated distribution
              of species ranges on a map, yielding the predicted number of
              species in each grid cell of the domain. In contrast to
              curve-fitting analysis, simulation modelling explicitly
              incorporates the processes believed to be affecting the
              geographical ranges of species and generates a number of
              quantitative predictions that can be compared to empirical
              patterns. We describe three of the 'control knobs' for a GSM that
              specify simple rules for dispersal, evolutionary origins and
              environmental gradients. Binary combinations of different knob
              settings correspond to eight distinct simulation models, five of
              which are already represented in the literature of macroecology.
              The output from such a GSM will include the predicted species
              richness per grid cell, the range size frequency distribution,
              the simulated phylogeny and simulated geographical ranges of the
              component species, all of which can be compared to empirical
              patterns. Challenges to the development of the GSM include the
              measurement of goodness of fit (GOF) between observed data and
              model predictions, as well as the estimation, optimization and
              interpretation of the model parameters. The simulation approach
              offers new insights into the origin and maintenance of species
              richness patterns, and may provide a common framework for
              investigating the effects of contemporary climate, evolutionary
              history and geometric constraints on global biodiversity
              gradients. With further development, the GSM has the potential to
              provide a conceptual bridge between macroecology and historical
              biogeography.",

               Savitzky--Golay filtering of raw phenological curves from pixels
               classified as vegetation. Moreover, the new method is conceived
               to face specificities of urban environments such as: the high
               heterogeneity of impervious/natural elements, the 3D structure
               of the city inducing shadows, the restricted spatial extent of
               individual tree crowns and the strong biodiversity of urban
               vegetation. Three vegetation indices have been studied:
               Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized
               Difference Red Edge Index 1 (NDRE1), which are mainly linked to
               chlorophyll content and leaf density and Normalized Burn Ratio
               (NBR) mostly correlated to water content and leaf density. The

              vector of species relative abundance of an entire assemblage and
              propose a novel estimator of the complete species-rank abundance
              distribution (RAD). Nearly all previous estimators of the RAD use
              the conventional ``plug-in'' estimator Pi (sample relative
              abundance) of the true relative abundance pi of species i.
              Because most biodiversity samples are incomplete, the plug-in
              estimators are applied only to the subset of species that are
              detected in the sample. Using the concept of sample coverage and
              its generalization, we propose a new statistical framework to
              estimate the complete RAD by separately adjusting the sample
              relative abundances for the set of species detected in the sample
              and estimating the relative abundances for the set of species
              undetected in the sample but inferred to be present in the
              assemblage. We first show that P, is a positively biased
              estimator of pi for species detected in the sample, and that the
              degree of bias increases with increasing relative rarity of each
              species. We next derive a method to adjust the sample relative
              abundance to reduce the positive bias inherent in j. The
              adjustment method provides a nonparametric resolution to the
              longstanding challenge of characterizing the relationship between
              the true relative abundance in the entire assemblage and the
              observed relative abundance in a sample. Finally, we propose a
              method to estimate the true relative abundances of the undetected
              species based on a lower bound of the number of undetected
              species. We then combine the adjusted RAD for the detected
              species and the estimated RAD for the undetected species to
              obtain the complete RAD estimator. Simulation results show that
              the proposed RAD curve can unveil the true RAD and is more
              accurate than the empirical RAD. We also extend our method to
              incidence data. Our formulas and estimators are illustrated using
              empirical data sets from surveys of forest spiders (for abundance
              data) and soil ciliates (for incidence data). The proposed RAD
              estimator is also applicable to estimating various diversity
              measures and should be widely useful to analyses of biodiversity

               ecologists' measures of species diversity, phylogenetic
               diversity, and distance-based functional diversity. It also
               provides a unified method of decomposing these diversities and

               review of the methods of measuring and assessing biological
               diversity, together with their application. The book's emphasis
               is on quantifying the variety, abundance, and occurrence of
               taxa, and on providing objective and clear guidance for both
               scientists and managers. This is a fast-moving field and one
               that is the focus of intense research interest. However the
               rapid development of new methods, the inconsistent and sometimes
               confusing application of old ones, and the lack of consensus in
               the literature about the best approach, means that there is a
               real need for a current synthesis. Biological Diversity covers
               fundamental measurement issues such as sampling, re-examines
               familiar diversity metrics (including species richness,
               diversity statistics, and estimates of spatial and temporal
               turnover), discusses species abundance distributions and how

               structure of biodiversity, and investigates alternative
               approaches used to assess trait, phylogenetic, and genetic
               diversity. The final section of the book turns to a selection of
               contemporary challenges such as measuring microbial diversity,
               evaluating the impact of disturbance, assessing biodiversity in
               managed landscapes, measuring diversity in the imperfect fossil

               or enhancing these programmes focus either on the end goals,
               that is the intended use of the data, or on how these goals are
               achieved, for example through volunteer involvement in citizen
               science, but not both. These recommendations are rarely
               prioritized.We used a collaborative approach, involving 52
               experts in biodiversity monitoring in the UK, to develop a list
               of attributes of relevance to any biodiversity monitoring
               programme and to order these attributes by their priority. We
               also ranked the attributes according to their importance in
               monitoring biodiversity in the UK. Experts involved included
               data users, funders, programme organizers and participants in
               data collection. They covered expertise in a wide range of
               taxa.We developed a final list of 25 attributes of biodiversity

               essential for monitoring schemes; e.g. articulate the objectives
               and gain sufficient participants) to the most aspirational (e.g.
               electronic data capture in the field, reporting change
               annually). This ordered list is a practical framework which can
               be used to support the development of monitoring
               programmes.People's ranking of attributes revealed a difference
               between those who considered attributes with benefits to end
               users to be most important (e.g. people from governmental
               organizations) and those who considered attributes with greatest
               benefit to participants to be most important (e.g. people
               involved with volunteer biological recording schemes). This
               reveals a distinction between focussing on aims and the
               pragmatism in achieving those aims. Synthesis and applications.
               The ordered list of attributes developed in this study will
               assist in prioritizing resources to develop biodiversity

              levels of urbanization is species loss (i.e., biotic

              specialization in urban landscapes. We sampled bird communities

              resolution EVI and NDVI values of the pixels within a 50-m buffer
              of bird sample points using Google Earth Engine (32-day Landsat 8
              Collection Tier 1). Mixed models were used to find the best
              associations of EVI and NDVI, predicting multiple avian diversity
              facets: Taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, phylogenetic
              diversity, specialization levels, and urban tolerance. A total of
              113 bird species across 15 cities from 10 different European
              countries were detected. EVI mean was the best predictor for
              foraging substrate specialization. NDVI mean was the best
              predictor for most avian diversity facets: taxonomic diversity,
              functional richness and evenness, phylogenetic diversity,
              phylogenetic species variability, community evolutionary

              different European cities. Our results thus covered a large
              spatial scale, confirming both effects of geographical and local
              attributes of the cities on avian diversity. However, we found
              contrasting effects for the different diversity components
              analyzed. Overall, taxonomic diversity (bird species richness),
              phylogenetic diversity and relatedness were significantly and
              negatively associated with latitude, while functional dispersion
              of communities showed no association whatsoever. At the local
              level (within the city), we found that urban greenery (grass,
              bush, and trees) is positively correlated with the number of
              breeding bird species, while the building cover showed a
              detrimental effect. Functional dispersion was the less affected
              diversity metric, while grass and trees and water (rivers or
              urban streams) positively affected the phylogenetic diversity of
              avian communities. Finally, the phylogenetic relatedness of
              species increased with all the main indicators of urbanization

              potential resilience of urban ecosystems exposed to the stress

              studies classify the urban landscape in more detail, quantifying
              separately the effects of individual urban features on
              biodiversity levels. However, while separate factors influencing
              biodiversity variation among cities worldwide have recently been
              analysed, a global analysis on the factors influencing
              biodiversity levels within cities is still lacking. We here
              present the first meta-analysis on intra-urban biodiversity
              variation across a large variety of taxonomic groups of 75 cities
              worldwide. Our results show that patch area and corridors have
              the strongest positive effects on biodiversity, complemented by
              vegetation structure. Local, biotic and management habitat
              variables were significantly more important than landscape,
              abiotic or design variables. Large sites greater than 50 ha are
              necessary to prevent a rapid loss of area-sensitive species. This
              indicates that, despite positive impacts of biodiversity-friendly
              management, increasing the area of habitat patches and creating a
              network of corridors is the most important strategy to maintain
              high levels of urban biodiversity.",

              service due to global declines of bees and other pollinators is
              cause for considerable concern. Habitat degradation, destruction
              and fragmentation due to agricultural intensification have
              historically been the main causes of this pollinator decline.
              However, despite increasing and accelerating levels of global
              urbanization, very little research has investigated the effects
              of urbanization on pollinator assemblages. We assessed changes in
              the diversity, abundance and species composition of bee and
              hoverfly pollinator assemblages in urban, suburban, and rural
              sites across a UK city. Methodology/Principal Findings: Bees and
              hoverflies were trapped and netted at 24 sites of similar habitat
              character (churchyards and cemeteries) that varied in position
              along a gradient of urbanization. Local habitat quality
              (altitude, shelter from wind, diversity and abundance of
              flowers), and the broader-scale degree of urbanization (e.g.
              percentage of built landscape and gardens within 100 m, 250 m,
              500 m, 1 km, and 2.5 km of the site) were assessed for each study
              site. The diversity and abundance of pollinators were both
              significantly negatively associated with higher levels of
              urbanization. Assemblage composition changed along the
              urbanization gradient with some species positively associated
              with urban and suburban land-use, but more species negatively so.
              Pollinator assemblages were positively affected by good site
              habitat quality, in particular the availability of flowering
              plants. Conclusions/Significance: Our results show that urban
              areas can support diverse pollinator assemblages, but that this
              capacity is strongly affected by local habitat quality.
              Nonetheless, in both urban and suburban areas of the city the
              assemblages had fewer individuals and lower diversity than
              similar rural habitats. The unique development histories of
              different urban areas, and the difficulty of assessing mobile
              pollinator assemblages in just part of their range, mean that
              complementary studies in different cities and urban habitats are
              required to discover if these findings are more widely
              applicable. \copyright{} 2011 Bates et al.",

  abstract  = "The effect of urbanization can be immense, yet our understanding
               is rudimentary. Here, we compile the most recent information on
               urban impacts on avian populations and communities. Compared to
               other vertebrates, birds are easily monitored by skilled
               observers and provide a mechanism to explore urban effects and
               responses to different urban designs. Taxonomically, bird
               communities in distinctly different habitats are most different
               in the least disturbed sites and the most similar in the most
               urbanized sites. Urbanization tends tAlterraAlterra, o select
               for omnivorous, granivorous, and cavity nesting species.
               Increased urbanization typically leads to an increase in avian
               biomass but a reduction in richness. Unlike most passerines,
               raptors may have home ranges that extend beyond the urban
               boundary and therefore do not need to meet all their ecological
               requirements within urban areas. Urban habitats are often of
               superior quality to raptors because there they are often free
               from persecution and have an adequate food supply. The processes
               that underlie the patterns of population and community level
               responses need more attention, but several areas of have been
               identified as being important. Birds respond to vegetation
               composition and structure, and urban areas that retain native
               vegetative characteristics retain more native species than those
               that do not. Avian fecundity in urban areas is a reflection of
               species-specific adaptability to urban resources, and to levels
               of nest predation and nest parasitism. Additionally,
               non-consumptive human activities that increase with urbanization
               are recognized as having negative impacts on avian populations
               and communities. Avian survivorship in urban areas is influenced
               by risk of collision with man-made objects, changes in the
               predator assemblage, food supply, and disease. Missing are
               thorough investigations in the regions of highest human
               population growth, e.g. Southeast Asia. Additionally, there is a
               paucity of information from regions of high avian diversity,
               e.g. tropical forests. Clearly, local knowledge and study is
               required before implementation of management policies to reduce
               urban impacts on bird communities. Hopefully, such policies will
               include long-term monitoring. Demographic parameters of
               fecundity and survivorship need to be examined in conjunction
               with measures of community diversity and density across the
               urban gradient to better understand the quality of different
               urban habitats, and the variation of quality among spatial
               patterns of urbanization within the native habitat matrix.

               inter-annual temporal vegetation dynamics, which reflects a
               change in land surface attributes. We explored 250-m
               multi-temporal MODIS EVI 16-day composite data from 2001 to 2007
               to characterize a change in vegetation dynamics related to

               time-frequency space by wavelet function in order to identify
               and reduce the overall noise so as not to lose useful
               information from the time series data. The results show that by
               characterizing temporal vegetation dynamics, it is possible to
               distinguish actual land-use change based on land-cover dynamics.
               The result was evaluated using 18,626 reference pixels and
               showed an overall accuracy of 76.10\%. In agricultural land use,
               such as upland and plantation, the weakest results were caused
               by mixed pixels from MODIS 250-m grid data as well as by
               temporal complexity related to the climate-driven change of land
               cover existing in the study area. On the other hand, for land
               use types which were not significantly affected by climate
               variability such as paddy rice fields with sufficient irrigation

               alternative when considering the accuracy of land-use change,
               which is not necessarily coincident with the temporary change in

              Biodiversity loss endangers essential ecosystem services and
              risks unacceptable environmental consequences. Global
              biodiversity observations are needed to provide a better
              understanding of the distribution of biodiversity, to better
              identify high priority areas for conservation and to help
              maintain essential ecosystem goods and services. Traditional in
              situ biodiversity monitoring is limited in time and space and is
              usually a costly and time-consuming enterprise. Remote sensing
              can provide data over a large area in a consistent, objective
              manner and has been used to detect plant biodiversity in a range
              of ecosystems, typically based on relating spectral properties to
              the distribution of habitat, species or functional groups. Recent
              years have witnessed the emergence of methods using imaging
              spectroscopy to assess biodiversity via plant traits or spectral
              information content. However, questions regarding the complex
              drivers of plant optical properties and the scale dependence of
              spectral diversity -- biodiversity relationship confound
              diversity monitoring using remote sensing and must first be
              better understood before these methods can be operationally
              applied. To address some of these topics, we (1) review the
              history of remote sensing approaches in biodiversity estimation,

              illustrate successes and major gaps of remote sensing of
              biodiversity, and (3) identify promising future directions. We
              focus on emerging methods using spectral diversity (optical
              diversity) as a proxy for terrestrial plant diversity that offer
              to revolutionize the study of diversity in its different
              dimensions (phylogenetic, taxonomic, and functional diversity)
              from remote sensing. We also discuss remaining knowledge gaps and
              ways spectral diversity might be effectively integrated into a

               This method took both habitat and species diversity into account

               biodiversity is huge. It is also very diverse, with different
               authors measuring fragmentation in different ways and, as a
               consequence, drawing different conclusions regarding both the
               magnitude and direction of its effects. Habitat fragmentation is
               usually defined as a landscape-scale process involving both
               habitat loss and the breaking apart of habitat. Results of
               empirical studies of habitat fragmentation are often difficult
               to interpret because (a) many researchers measure fragmentation
               at the patch scale, not the landscape scale and (b) most
               researchers measure fragmentation in ways that do not
               distinguish between habitat loss and habitat fragmentation per
               se, i.e., the breaking apart of habitat after controlling for
               habitat loss. Empirical studies to date suggest that habitat
               loss has large, consistently negative effects on biodiversity.
               Habitat fragmentation per se has much weaker effects on
               biodiversity that are at least as likely to be positive as
               negative. Therefore, to correctly interpret the influence of
               habitat fragmentation on biodiversity, the effects of these two
               components of fragmentation must be measured independently. More
               studies of the independent effects of habitat loss and
               fragmentation per se are needed to determine the factors that
               lead to positive versus negative effects of fragmentation per
               se. I suggest that the term ?fragmentation? should be reserved
               for the breaking apart of habitat, independent of habitat loss.",

  abstract = "Several small habitat patches typically contain more species than
              a single large patch of comparable area. This pattern has fueled
              controversy over reserve design (the SLOSS debate); yet its
              causes remain poorly understood, limiting discussion of any
              broader biodiversity implications. Using 44 published faunal
              metacommunity datasets from fragments, islands and habitat
              islands, we test four hypotheses to explain differences in
              species richness (SRd) between several small patches and a single
              large patch: (i) beta diversity (BD); (ii) evenness of species
              abundance distributions (EV); (iii) size bias in sampling
              efficiency (SE); and (iv) taxonomy. We used individual-based null
              models and confirmatory path analysis to compare direct and
              indirect support for these non-exclusive hypotheses. Broad
              taxonomic grouping (invertebrates > birds = non-volant
              vertebrates) accounted for most of the variation in SRd, while
              BD, EV and SE had smaller, but comparable, direct effects
              (standardized coefficients = 0.42, 0.31 and −0.26 respectively).
              Within a taxonomic group, larger SRd occurred when both BD and EV
              increase. Although sampling bias probably overstates the
              difference in SRd, it does not explain the pattern. Beyond
              reserve design, the SLOSS pattern implies potential principles
              for managing biodiversity in fragmented landscapes. Whether this
              pattern should inform conservation requires greater
              understanding. We confirm beta diversity is the major
              contributor, but it is mediated by increases and decreases in
              evenness among small patches. Attention to how sub-division
              alters relative abundances (e.g., by biotic relaxation or
              altering competitive outcomes) might help clarify how the SLOSS
              pattern arises.",

               investigated the relationship between land use variables and the
               abundance of 129 bird species from the Taiwan Breeding Bird
               Survey. We also administered a questionnaire to 24 expert
               birdwatchers as an alternative method for estimating the habitat
               associations of the 129 bird species. The classifications of 104
               species into habitat association classes using the two methods
               were well aligned, with 75 species (72.1\%) classified

              of wild species, is a vital component of conservation practice
              and policy. We created a database of nearly 1200 schemes, ranging
              in start date from 1800 to 2018, to review spatial, temporal,
              taxonomic, and methodological patterns in global species
              monitoring. We identified monitoring schemes through standardized
              web searches, an online survey of stakeholders, in-depth national
              searches in a sample of countries, and a review of global
              biodiversity databases. We estimated the total global number of
              monitoring schemes operating at 3300-15,000. Since 2000, there
              has been a sharp increase in the number of new schemes being
              initiated in lower- and middle-income countries and in
              megadiverse countries, but a decrease in high-income countries.
              The total number of monitoring schemes in a country and its per
              capita gross domestic product were strongly, positively
              correlated. Schemes that were active in 2018 had been running for
              an average of 21 years in high-income countries, compared with 13
              years in middle-income countries and 10 years in low-income
              countries. In high-income countries, over one-half of monitoring
              schemes received government funding, but this was less than
              one-quarter in low-income countries. Data collection was
              undertaken partly or wholly by volunteers in 37\% of schemes, and
              such schemes covered significantly more sites and species than
              those undertaken by professionals alone. Birds were by far the
              most widely monitored taxonomic group, accounting for around half
              of all schemes, but this bias declined over time. Monitoring in
              most taxonomic groups remains sparse and uncoordinated, and most
              of the data generated are elusive and unlikely to feed into wider
              biodiversity conservation processes. These shortcomings could be
              addressed by, for example, creating an open global meta-database
              of biodiversity monitoring schemes and enhancing capacity for
              species monitoring in countries with high biodiversity. Article

              complex information, so underlying information influencing its
              reliability and interpretation (e.g., variability in data and
              uncertainty in indicator values) can be lost. Communicating
              uncertainty is necessary to ensure robust decisions and limit
              misinterpretations of trends, yet variability and uncertainty are
              rarely quantified in biodiversity indicators. We developed a
              guide to representing uncertainty and variability in biodiversity
              indicators. We considered the key purposes of biodiversity
              indicators and commonly used methods for representing uncertainty
              (standard error, bootstrap resampling, and jackknife resampling)
              and variability (quantiles, standard deviation, median absolute
              deviation, and mean absolute deviation) with intervals. Using 3
              high-profile biodiversity indicators (Red List Index, Living
              Planet Index, and Ocean Health Index), we tested the use,
              suitability, and interpretation of each interval method based on
              the formulation and data types underpinning the indicators. The

  abstract = "Many studies have described the effects of urbanization on
              species richness. These studies indicate that urbanization can
              increase or decrease species richness, depending on several
              variables. Some of these variables include: taxonomic group,
              spatial scale of analysis, and intensity of urbanization. Recent
              reviews of birds (the most-studied group) indicate that species
              richness decreases with increasing urbanization in most cases but
              produces no change or even increases richness in some studies.
              Here I expand beyond the bird studies by reviewing 105 studies on
              the effects of urbanization on the species richness of non-avian
              species: mammals, reptiles, amphibians, invertebrates and plants.
              For all groups, species richness tends to be reduced in areas
              with extreme urbanization (i.e., central urban core areas).
              However, the effects of moderate levels of urbanization (i.e.,
              suburban areas) vary significantly among groups. Most of the
              plant studies (about 65\%) indicate increasing species richness
              with moderate urbanization whereas only a minority of
              invertebrate studies (about 30\%) and a very small minority of
              non-avian vertebrate studies (about 12\%) show increasing species
              richness. Possible explanations for these results are discussed,

              threats to biodiversity through both species extinction and
              biotic homogenization. Most studies focusing on urban ecosystems
              have been conducted in temperate forests of the Northern
              hemisphere; the ecological and socioeconomic contexts, however,
              may influence biodiversity responses to urbanization. We ask
              whether the biomes (here, the humid subtropical forest and the
              semiarid shrubland) where human settlements and land uses are
              developed determine bird diversity along urbanization gradients
              in the southern Neotropics. We propose theoretical responses
              based on expected variations in vegetation cover along
              urbanization gradients and fit our data to different models of
              bird richness from highly developed to non-urban areas and also
              examine changes in species composition. Species richness was
              positively correlated to vegetation cover in both human
              settlements. Results supported some of our predictions. In the
              city located in the arid biome, the highly developed area
              supported higher bird richness than the natural habitat, unlike
              the city from the humid biome; yet, the native bird assemblage
              was better preserved in the urban area established in the humid
              biome. Richness in moderately developed areas was either higher
              than or similar to that in rural or natural areas in the
              settlement from the arid biome, but lower than or similar to
              richness in the humid biome. In all the studied urban--rural
              gradients, bird richness reached a plateau in moderately
              developed areas, in contrast to urban-natural habitat gradients,
              where richness either increased (in the humid biome) or declined
              (in the arid biome). Our study helps to understand how the
              mechanisms changing biodiversity in urbanized areas may act in
              different biomes and land uses, and therefore contributes to the
              search of global explanations of diversity patterns.",

              multiple-site dissimilarity among all sampling units, it is not
              informative on the changes of multiple-site dissimilarity as a
              function of sampling effort. For gamma diversity, this pattern is
              usually represented as a species accumulation curve, which is the
              graph of the number of observed species when the number of plots
              varies from 1 to N. Here, we will show that species accumulation

               We sampled coastal vegetation within two habitats (foredunes and
               saltmarshes) along nine belt transects in two sampling sites.
               Plant species richness and abundance were assessed in 128 plots
               along with a suite of plant functional traits. We tested for
               differences in community-weighted means between native and alien

               provided insights into traits fostering the invasion success

               lower functional diversity than natives and were characterized
               by lower leaf construction costs coupled with lower drought

              address the issue of the spatial arrangement of sampling units
              when computing sample-based rarefaction curves. If the spatial
              arrangement is neglected when building rarefaction curves, a

              areas that differ in their spatial extent is not possible, even

              richness estimates through the use of data from a temperate
              forest. We show that the use of Spatially Constrained Rarefaction
              (SCR) results in species richness estimates that are directly

              captured by the SCR, thus providing a useful technique for
              characterizing the spatial structure of biodiversity patterns.

               Over the past decade, a dizzying array of tools and methods were
               generated to incorporate phylogenetic and functional information
               into traditional ecological analyses. Increasingly these tools
               are implemented in R, thus greatly expanding their impact.
               Researchers getting started in R can use this volume as a
               step-by-step entryway into phylogenetic and functional analyses
               for ecology in R. More advanced users will be able to use this
               volume as a quick reference to understand particular analyses.
               The volume begins with an introduction to the R environment and
               handling relevant data in R. Chapters then cover phylogenetic
               and functional metrics of biodiversity; null modeling and
               randomizations for phylogenetic and functional trait analyses;
               integrating phylogenetic and functional trait information; and
               interfacing the R environment with a popular C-based program.
               This book presents a unique approach through its focus on
               ecological analyses and not macroevolutionary analyses. The
               author provides his own code, so that the reader is guided
               through the computational steps to calculate the desired
               metrics. This guided approach simplifies the work of determining
               which package to use for any given analysis. Example datasets
               are shared to help readers practice, and readers can then
               quickly turn to their own datasets.",

  abstract  = "The value of biodiversity lies in its option value for the
               future, the greater the complement of contemporary biodiversity

               ensure continued evolution in a changing and uncertain world.
               From this perspective, biodiversity option value can be equated
               with richness in the different features expressed by species. An
               individual species of greater value is one contributing more
               novel features to a given subset. The feature diversity of
               species and communities is difficult to estimate directly, but
               can be predicted by the phylogenetic relationships among the
               species. The `Phylogenetic Diversity' measure (PD) (Faith,
               1992a) estimates the relative feature diversity of any nominated
               set of species by the sum of the lengths of all those branches
               spanned by the set. These branch lengths reflect patristic or
               path-length distances. This study first reviews and expands on
               some of the properties of PD, and develops simple modifications

               each sample. Then the application of PD, $\delta$nPD and enPD to
               a wide range of conservation and resource management issues is
               demonstrated using avian case studies. Supertree construction
               procedures (matrix representation using parsimony analysis;
               average consensus) were used to combine the extensive DNA-DNA
               hybridization tree of Sibley \& Ahlquist (1990) with numerous,
               recently published phylogenetic reconstructions to derive a
               phylogenetic tree for the global avian fauna. Using this
               supertree as a systematic framework, the utility of PD was
               demonstrated in four case studies: (i) state of the environment
               reporting, with changes in avian faunas resulting from
               extinctions quantified as indicators of the state of
               biodiversity at Global, New Zealand and Waikato region scales,
               and changes in available habitat quantified as indicators of
               pressures on biodiversity in the Waikato region; (ii) setting
               priorities for threatened species management, with PD as a
               measure of option value integrated with information on
               survivorship expectations to develop a ranking among threatened
               New Zealand forest bird species; (iii) monitoring biotic
               response to management, with data from 5-minute counts used to
               analyse changes in forest bird communities under three
               management regimes in New Zealand; and (iv) selection of
               indicator species, with PD used to objectively identify subsets
               of species in the Global, New Zealand and Waikato avian faunas
               that comprise a high proportion of the option value in those

               identifying land cover types that are spectrally distinct and

              new opportunities for biodiversity modelling, due in part to the
              wide spatial coverage of information. Recently proposed occupancy
              modelling approaches naturally incorporate random effects in
              order to account for annual variation in the composition of sites
              surveyed. In turn this leads to Bayesian analysis and model
              fitting, which are typically extremely time consuming. Motivated
              by presence-only records of occurrence from the UK Butterflies
              for the New Millennium data base, we present an alternative
              approach, in which site variation is described in a standard way
              through logistic regression on relevant environmental covariates.
              This allows efficient occupancy model-fitting using classical
              inference, which is easily achieved using standard computers.
              This is especially important when models need to be fitted each
              year, typically for many different species, as with British
              butterflies for example. Using both real and simulated data we
              demonstrate that the two approaches, with and without random
              effects, can result in similar conclusions regarding trends.
              There are many advantages to classical model-fitting, including
              the ability to compare a range of alternative models, identify
              appropriate covariates and assess model fit, using standard tools
              of maximum likelihood. In addition, modelling in terms of
              covariates provides opportunities for understanding the
              ecological processes that are in operation. We show that there is
              even greater potential; the classical approach allows us to
              construct regional indices simply, which indicate how changes in
              occupancy typically vary over a species' range. In addition we
              are also able to construct dynamic occupancy maps, which provide
              a novel, modern tool for examining temporal changes in species
              distribution. These new developments may be applied to a wide
              range of taxa, and are valuable at a time of climate change. They
              also have the potential to motivate citizen scientists.",

              taxonomic coverage: a lot is known about the trends of groups
              such as birds, butterflies and mammals, but little is known about
              invertebrates and plants. This is due to the lack of abundance
              data for these groups. However, alternative data such as
              occurrence records are available for a vast range of species and
              advances in methodologies are enabling their robust analysis.
              Here, I analyse UK occurrence records using Bayesian occupancy
              modelling techniques to determine the status, patterns and
              drivers of change in less well-studied taxa. First, variations of
              an occupancy modelling framework were tested to determine whether
              methods could be improved. This resulted in a ``random walk''
              model that could analyse sparse occurrence records while
              producing results with increased precision and reduced bias when
              compared to other variants. This enabled the application of the
              model to data for over 12,000 species from 32 taxa including
              vascular plants and numerous invertebrate groups. The resulting
              estimates of annual occupancy present new information on
              large-scale change from fine-grained data. Exploration of these
              estimates showed that trends are not consistent with those of
              well-studied taxa. Occupancy estimates were then used to assess
              change in three forms of biodiversity trend: local alpha
              diversity, regional alpha diversity and regional beta diversity.
              This revealed the multifaceted nature of biodiversity change and
              the need to monitor across metrics and scales. Finally, a
              Bayesian, multispecies, dynamic occupancy model was used to
              determine the effect of water quality on the population dynamics
              of freshwater invertebrates. This work highlights the potential
              of occurrence records to investigate biodiversity change and
              brings to light new information on many species that have not
              previously been studied at a national scale.",

              forming a single index to inform research, policy and management.
              Much detail is typically lost when such indices are constructed.
              Here we investigate the potential of Functional Data Analysis,
              focussing upon Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA),
              which can be easily carried out using standard R programs, as a
              tool for displaying features of the underlying information.
              Illustrations are provided using data from the UK Butterflies for
              the New Millennium and UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme databases.
              The FPCAs conducted result in a huge simplification in terms of
              dimensional reduction, allowing species occupancy and abundance
              to be reduced to two and three dimensions, respectively. We show
              that a functional principal component arises for both occupancy
              and abundance analyses that distinguishes between species that
              increase or decrease over time, and that it differs from
              percentage trend, which is a simplification of complex temporal
              changes. We find differences in species patterns of occupancy and
              abundance, providing a warning against routinely combining both
              types of index within multi-species indicators, for example when
              using occupancy as a proxy for abundance when insufficient
              abundance data are available. By identifying the differences
              between species, figures displaying functional principal
              component scores are much more informative than the simple bar
              plots of percentages of significant trends that often accompany
              multi-species indicators. Informed by the outcomes of the FPCA,
              we make recommendations for accompanying visualisations for
              multi-species indicators, and discuss how these are likely to be
              context and audience specific. We show that, in the absence of
              FPCA, using mean species occupancy and total abundance can
              provide additional, accessible information to complement
              species-level trends. At the simplest level, we suggest using
              jitter plots to display variation in species-level trends. We
              encourage further application to other taxa, and recommend the
              routine augmentation of multi-species indicators in the future
              with additional statistical procedures and figures, to serve as

               recovery. In this study, we use large citizen science datasets
               to derive trends in invertebrate occupancy in Great Britain
               between 1990 and 2019. We compare these trends between regions
               of no- (0\%), low- (greater than 0--50\%) and high-cropland
               (greater than 50\%) cover, which includes arable and
               horticultural crops. Although we detect general declines,
               invertebrate groups are declining most strongly in high-cropland
               cover regions. This suggests that even in the light of improved
               policy and management over the last 30 years, the way we are
               managing cropland is failing to conserve and restore
               invertebrate communities. New policy-based drivers and
               incentives are required to support the resilience and
               sustainability of agricultural ecosystems. Post-Brexit changes

               biodiversity change over short time periods. Long-term
               monitoring schemes provide high-quality data, often on an annual
               basis, but are taxonomically and geographically restricted. By
               contrast, opportunistic biological records are relatively
               unstructured but vast in quantity. Recently, these data have
               been applied to increasingly elaborate science and policy
               questions, using a range of methods. At present, we lack a firm
               understanding of which methods, if any, are capable of
               delivering unbiased trend estimates on policy-relevant
               time-scales. We identified a set of candidate methods that
               employ data filtering criteria and/or correction factors to deal
               with variation in recorder activity. We designed a computer
               simulation to compare the statistical properties of these
               methods under a suite of realistic data collection scenarios. We
               measured the Type I error rates of each method?scenario
               combination, as well as the power to detect genuine trends. We
               found that simple methods produce biased trend estimates, and/or
               had low power. Most methods are robust to variation in sampling
               effort, but biases in spatial coverage, sampling effort per
               visit, and detectability, as well as turnover in community
               composition, all induced some methods to fail. No method was
               wholly unaffected by all forms of variation in recorder
               activity, although some performed well enough to be useful. We
               warn against the use of simple methods. Sophisticated methods
               that model the data collection process offer the greatest
               potential to estimate timely trends, notably Frescalo and
               occupancy?detection models. The potential of these methods and
               the value of opportunistic data would be further enhanced by
               assessing the validity of model assumptions and by capturing
               small amounts of information about sampling intensity at the

               defined as measurements or estimates of species' occupancy along
               the axes of space, time and taxonomy. In the ``ideal'' case,
               additional stipulations have been proposed: occupancy should be
               characterized contiguously along each axis at grain sizes
               relevant to policy and process (i.e., fine scale); and the SD
               EBV should be global in extent, or at least span the entirety of
               the focal taxa's geographical range (Jetz et al. 2019). These
               stipulations set the bar very high and, unsurprisingly, most
               operational SD EBVs fall short of these ideal criteria. In this
               presentation, I will discuss the major challenges associated
               with developing the idealized SD EBV. I will demonstrate these
               challenges using an operational SD EBV spanning ~6000 species in
               the United Kingdom (UK) over the period 1970 to 2019 as a case
               study (Outhwaite et al. 2019). In short, this data product
               comprises annual estimates of occupancy for each species in all
               sampled 1 km cells across the UK; these are derived from
               opportunistically-collected species occurrence data using
               occupancy-detection models (K{\'e}ry et al. 2010). Having
               discussed which of the ``ideal'' criteria the case study
               satisfies, I will then touch on what are, in my view, two
               underappreciated challenges when constructing SD EBVs: dealing
               with sampling biases in the underlying data and the difficulty
               in evaluating the extent to which they bias the final product.
               These challenges should be addressed as a matter of urgency, as
               SD EBVs are increasingly applied in important settings such as
               underpinning national and international biodiversity indicators

                 valuable source of information on biodiversity for a wide
                 range of taxonomic groups. Although these citizen science data
                 are opportunistic and unstructured, occupancy analysis can be
                 used to quantify trends in distribution. However, occupancy
                 analysis of unstructured data can be resource-intensive and
                 requires substantial expertise. It is valuable to have simple
                 `rules of thumb' to efficiently assess the suitability of a
                 dataset for occupancy analysis prior to analysis.Our analysis
                 was possible due to the production of trends, from our
                 Bayesian occupancy analysis, for 10 967 species from 34
                 multi-species recording schemes in Great Britain. These
                 schemes had an average of 500 visits to sites per year, and an
                 average of 20\% of visited sites received a revisit in a year.
                 Occupancy trend outputs varied in their precision and we used
                 expert elicitation on a subset of outputs to determine a
                 precision threshold above which trends were suitable for
                 further consideration. We then used classification trees with
                 seven metrics to define simple rules explaining when the data
                 would result in outputs that met the precision threshold.We
                 found that the suitability of a species' data was best
                 described by (i) the number of records of the focal species in
                 the 10\% best-recorded years, and (ii) the proportion of
                 recording visits for that taxonomic group with non-detections
                 of the focal species. Surprisingly few data were required to
                 be predicted to meet the precision threshold. Specifically,
                 for 98\% confidence that our Bayesian occupancy models would
                 produce outputs meeting the precision threshold, there needed
                 to be $\geq$29 records of the focal species in the 10\%
                 best-recorded years (equivalent to an average of 12.5 records
                 per year in our dataset), although only $\geq$10 records
                 (equivalent to 4.5 records per year) were required for species
                 recorded in less than 1 in 25 visits.We applied these rules to
                 regional species data for Great Britain. Data from 32\% of the
                 species:region combinations met the precision threshold with
                 80\% confidence, and 14\% with 98\% confidence. There was
                 great variation between taxonomic groups (e.g. butterflies,
                 moths and dragonflies were well recorded) and region (e.g.
                 south-east England was best recorded).These simple criteria
                 provide no indication of the accuracy or representativeness of
                 the trend outputs: this is vital, but needs to be assessed
                 individually. However our criteria do provide a rapid,

               N‐mixture abundance models in a Bayesian framework",

  abstract  = "Obtaining unbiased estimates of wildlife distribution and
               abundance is an important objective in research and management.
               Occupancy and N‐mixture abundance models, which correct for
               imperfect detection, are commonly used for this purpose. Fitting
               these models in a Bayesian framework has advantages but doing so
               can be challenging and time‐consuming for many researchers. We
               developed an R package, ubms, which provides an easy‐to‐use,
               formula‐based interface for fitting occupancy, N‐mixture
               abundance and other models in a Bayesian framework using Stan.
               The package also provides tools for visualizing parameter
               effects, calculating residuals, assessing goodness‐of‐fit and
               comparing models. We demonstrate the use of ubms by fitting an
               N‐mixture model to ruffed grouse Bonasa umbellus count data from
               drumming surveys conducted at roadside points sampled on five
               occasions annually during 2013--2015. To demonstrate the
               functionality of ubms, we used survey site as a random effect,
               and occasion date and per cent aspen cover at each site as
               covariates of detection and abundance respectively. The
               top‐ranked model included a positive effect of per cent aspen on
               grouse abundance. ubms has the potential to greatly increase the
               range of users who will be able to rigorously assess species
               distribution and abundance while correcting for imperfect
               detection in a Bayesian framework.",
